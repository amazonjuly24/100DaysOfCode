Michel Barnier: EU willing to compromise if UK softens red lines,"[""Lisa O'Carroll""]","The EU is prepared to change its Brexit position if Theresa May softens her negotiating red lines, Michel Barnier has said.

The offer from the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator could be seen as a strategic olive branch coming just as the prime minister tries to strike a deal between the warring sides of her cabinet at Chequers.

“I am ready to adapt our offer should the UK red lines change,” Barnier said in a speech to the Institute of International and European Affairs in Brussels. “Our objective has always been to find an agreement with the UK, not against.”

He called on all sides to stop arguing over the Irish border, imploring everyone to “de-dramatise” the issue.

However, he said the EU would not shift its own red line on the single market, which he said was “not and never should be seen as a big supermarket; it is economic, cultural and social life, it should be developed in all its dimensions”.

He added: “The single market is our main economic public good. We will not damage it. We will not unravel what we achieved with the UK. We must find solutions that respect the integrity of the single market.”

This may douse any hopes that the prime minister could emerge from Chequers on Friday night with a package that simultaneously unites the cabinet and is acceptable to the EU, which has always said access to the single market is conditional on the UK accepting freedom of movement of people.

Hardline Brexiters were horrified to learn that May was preparing to soften her red lines by asking for access to the single market for goods, but not services, and will see Barnier’s comments as confirmation that the EU will not countenance a special compromise for Britain on immigration.

However, the conciliatory tone of Barnier’s speech was striking and may help move negotiations to the next phase. On Northern Ireland, he repackaged the need for a backstop solution, spelling out the need for regulatory alignment for livestock and agri-food. He said this was necessary for food safety and animal health across the border and would allow farming to continue as it does.

“We must all de-dramatise this backstop, we need to clarify how and where these controls are done, but ultimately [they are] only technical control on goods, no more, no less,” Barnier said.

“Our own backstop solution would mean the limited set of EU rules would continue to apply in Ireland as it does today, which means there would be no need for checks at the border.”

He again warned that the clock was ticking and the EU needed to see “realistic and workable solutions” from the UK.

For the first time he conceded there was still work to be done on protecting the rights of British citizens living in the rest of Europe and non-British EU citizens in the UK.

“There are four or five million citizens for whom Brexit is a constant source of worry [about] whether they can continue living their lives with the same rights for the rest of their lives. This is not the end of the road and we need to remain vigilant,” he said.",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0286be8902d0a2ac7e8fd92fb57f81f1b9b49f6e/0_87_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvZDM1ODZhNWVmNTc4MTc1NmQyMWEzYjYzNWU1MTcxNDEvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc=&s=aaa713c97f7133750991347c7bfb0576,[],https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/06/michel-barnier-eu-willing-to-compromise-if-uk-softens-brexit-red-lines,2018-07-06T14:13:37

Sinkhole traps truck as UK heatwave takes toll on roads,['Matthew Weaver'],"The UK is forecast to bask in hot weather for a third weekend in a row, with temperatures of more than 30C widely predicted, but for some the heatwave is proving too much.

Excessive heat has forced the cancellation of a series of events including pet shows in Halifax and Cheltenham and a lantern festival in Derbyshire. The hot spell has also opened up a number of sinkholes in roads.

A council refuse truck had to be towed out of Old Bath Road in Newbury, Berkshire, after getting submerged in a sinkhole. Veolia, which owns the truck, said none of its crew were hurt in the incident.

In Heaton in Newcastle fire crews were called after a man got his foot stuck in a sinkhole when the the tarmac melted. Tyne and Wear fire and rescue service said the 24-year-old man, who has not been named, had to be freed with a hammer and chisel.

It said the man had been “on his way to buy breakfast when he stepped on some tarmac, lost his footing and went straight through the road … Thankfully he didn’t break his ankle as he was wearing his grandad’s Dr Martens.”

Several local authorities including Hampshire, Cumbria, Kirklees, Cornwall and Lancashire deployed gritters to dust sand on roads as a form of sunscreen for the tarmac.



Jack Cousens, the head of roads policy for the AA, said: “Sinkholes are often associated with persistent rainfall, but this long period of strong sun baking the road network could lead to some sinkholes appearing. As the temperature rises, the soil underneath the road surface can shrink back causing cracks in the tarmac and the possibility of creating sinkholes.

“With at least two instances of sinkholes appearing at opposite ends of the country, road inspectors must keep an eye on their network and ensure they do all they can to prevent any further sinkholes developing.”

A lanterns festival planned for this month in Buxton, Derbyshire, has been cancelled because of the potential fire risk. Lights Fest was to involve thousands of paper lanterns being released into the night sky at Buxton Raceway on 28 July.

The police and fire service urged the organisers to cancel the event in part because of the exceptionally dry conditions of the surrounding countryside.

Sgt Darren Belfield of Derbyshire police said: “The countryside could have become littered with the remnants of these lanterns. But they also pose a real risk to wildlife and property, and could start fires in a countryside that is already extremely dry due to the hot weather. The devastation caused with the recent moorland fires shows just how serious fires in the open can be and how quickly they can spread.”

Sunny weather is forecast to continue into the weekend and beyond with temperatures of up to 32C in the south and 26C in the north. Slightly fresher weather is forecast by the middle of next week.",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2ff8c7e83eb3ba50ec37885bf2fc54da6e5b6cf/0_0_3289_1974/master/3289.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvZDM1ODZhNWVmNTc4MTc1NmQyMWEzYjYzNWU1MTcxNDEvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc=&s=72e43551c5fa62bb78cb4a98d37011d0,[],https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/06/sinkhole-traps-truck-as-uk-heatwave-takes-toll-on-roads,2018-07-06T16:45:20
Donald Trump to almost entirely avoid London during UK visit,"['Peter Walker', 'Shaista Aziz', 'Asad Rehman', 'Gary Younge']","Meetings with Theresa May and the Queen to be held away from protests in capital

Donald Trump will almost entirely avoid London during his four-day visit to the UK next week, Downing Street has said, unveiling an itinerary that is likely to prompt accusations he is trying to avoid planned protests against him.

While the US president is conducting his meetings, the first lady, Melania Trump, will have an agenda of her own, in the company of her opposite number, Philip May.

Trump, who is to meet Theresa May and the Queen among others before spending two days in Scotland, will only spend the night in London on Thursday, the day of his arrival, staying at the US ambassador’s official residence in Regent’s Park, Winfield House.

Before that he will attend a gala dinner at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire, and the following day he will hold talks with the prime minister at her Chequers country retreat in Buckinghamshire. Both are places where protesters can be kept out of sight and earshot.

Later on the Friday he will meet the Queen at Windsor Castle before heading to Scotland for the weekend.

Details about what Trump will do in Scotland will be released next week, but No 10 has described the leg as “a private element of the official visit”. There is widespread speculation he will spend part of it playing golf.

The US ambassador to the UK, Woody Johnson, rejected the suggestion Trump was trying to keep away from any dissent.

“No, the president is not avoiding anything,” he told a press briefing. “The president is merely trying to get as impactful a trip as he can get in a 24-hour period.” Trump will be using London as a base during his visit, Johnson said.

Activists have promised to stage protests against Trump throughout his visit, with an event planned in London next Friday expected to be the biggest.

While he is in the capital, a giant “Trump baby” balloon, caricaturing him as a nappy-wearing infant, will be flown in the sky over Westminster after the Greater London Authority (GLA) granted the creators permission.

Asked whether Trump had heard of the baby balloon, Johnson said: “Yes, I think we’re all aware of these things.” While the president was focused on his objectives, he “appreciates free speech, both in this country and in our country”, Johnson added.

May’s spokeswoman, who confirmed Trump would fly into the UK for the working visit direct from a Nato summit in Brussels, also denied that the president was avoiding Downing Street to stay away from protests.

“Prime ministers frequently make use of Chequers for meetings with foreign leaders,” she said. “It offers a more informal setting for important bilateral discussions. We’re looking forward to making sure the president has a chance to see and experience the UK beyond London and the south-east.

“We are a free and open democracy, and we believe in the right to peaceful protest. But I would also say that I think the majority of British people understand the importance of the UK-US alliance.”

Regarding the “Trump baby” balloon, the spokeswoman said it was up to the GLA to explain why they had approved it. “From our perspective, the presidential visit is an important moment to recognise our close and special relationship and to have open and frank discussions on the key issues,” she said.

Melania Trump will accompany her husband for some events, for example at Blenheim Palace and to meet the Queen, but she will also have a separate itinerary, hosted by May’s husband.

May invited Trump for a formal state visit after she met him in Washington shortly after his inauguration. However, such a visit, which is different to this working visit, has been delayed indefinitely, reportedly because the president did not want to be met by protests.

The black-tie dinner at Blenheim Palace, the country estate where Winston Churchill was born, will nonetheless see considerable ceremony, including the bands of Scots, Irish and Welsh Guards welcoming Trump, and an orchestra serenading diners with “classic British and American hits”.

About 100 guests will include some ministers and business leaders from sectors including financial services, travel, food and drink, and engineering.

On the Friday morning, Trump and May will visit an as-yet unnamed defence site connected to joint UK-US military training.

This will be followed by the main talks with May at Chequers and a working lunch. Afterwards – in what could be the most politically tricky part of the visit for Trump – the pair will hold a joint press conference.

Asked whether May was looking forward to hosting the US president, her spokeswoman replied: “Yes.”",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e677559b5dc209bb9ecacbc175b5f18139e6564/112_0_3204_1923/master/3204.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvZDM1ODZhNWVmNTc4MTc1NmQyMWEzYjYzNWU1MTcxNDEvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc=&s=35838d912558096abe40e621c73c43ed,[],https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/06/donald-trump-to-avoid-london-during-uk-visit,2018-07-06T16:00:04
Second man arrested over Lancashire moorland fire,['Frances Perraudin'],"A second man has been arrested on suspicion of arson, as a moorland fire in Lancashire burns into its second week.

Police arrested the 20-year-old man from Wigan on Friday morning on suspicion of causing a fire with intent to endanger life. It comes a week after a 22-year-old man from Bolton was arrested in connection with the fire. He was later released pending further inquiries.

Firefighters are continuing to tackle the blaze that started more than a week ago on Winter Hill, north-west of Bolton. On Thursday the fire service set up a 3 sq mile exclusion zone around the moorland blaze, banning walkers from the area.

The fire service, which released an image of the area stretching from Rivington village to Horrocks Moor, said: “[The map] shows the areas we need people to stay clear of; not only for public safety but to help us maintain the progress we’ve made so we can give you back full access ASAP.”

Last week about 100 soldiers and an RAF Chinook helicopter were drafted in to help with another, larger moorland fire, which continues to burn 30 miles away near Saddleworth Moor. The fire is now said to be under control and soldiers assisting the fire service were stood down on Friday.

Police confirmed on Wednesday that they were also treating the fire near Saddleworth Moor as arson, reporting that witnesses had seen people lighting a bonfire on land near to Buckton Vale, north of Stalybridge, at around 7.30pm on Sunday 24 June. Firefighters were able to extinguish the fire near Buckton Vale, but it reignited the following Tuesday because of the high temperatures.

Beverley Hughes, the deputy mayor of Greater Manchester, said on Friday that fire crews were making good progress and that the operation would be scaled down. Speaking following a visit to Winter Hill, the region’s mayor, Andy Burnham, said some crews would also be able to leave that area.

“I wanted to come here again today to say a huge thank you to all the crews fighting this fire including crews from Greater Manchester, Lancashire and many other fire and rescue services. They are working incredibly hard and the public are so grateful for their efforts,” said Burnham.

Maj Phil Morgan, from the Royal Regiment of Scotland, said: “It’s been a real privilege to be involved in this firefighting effort. Not only has the task been completed but we have strengthened the bonds that already exist between the army and our civilian partners.”",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdb835c114daf36ddfc14d90b4a9321feaef2964/0_285_4278_2567/master/4278.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvZDM1ODZhNWVmNTc4MTc1NmQyMWEzYjYzNWU1MTcxNDEvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc=&s=0ce29178d978356c0071e41d843efb64,[],https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/06/second-man-arrested-over-lancashire-moorland-fire,2018-07-06T16:09:42

Top oncologist to study effect of diet on cancer drugs,['Hannah Devlin'],"A groundbreaking clinical trial on whether diet could boost the effectiveness of cancer drugs is set to be launched by one of the world’s leading oncologists.

The work, led by Siddhartha Mukherjee at Columbia University Medical Center in New York, will investigate whether a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet could improve outcomes for patients with lymphoma and endometrial cancer.

The trial, which is initially recruiting 40 patients, is the first in a series of similar interventions being planned at other centres in the US and Europe by members of a new international working group focused on “rethinking human diets for cancer”, said Mukherjee, who is best known for writing the Pulitzer prize-winning book The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer.

“Physiologically we’re discovering that not every calorie is equal,” he said. “You could have two different diets, equal in terms of energy, but with two very different effects on the cancer.”

The first cohort, who will begin treatment in October, are lymphoma patients with cancers that have not responded to treatment. They will be followed by endometrial cancer patients, and the team is awaiting approval to treat women with drug-resistant breast cancer.

The patients will be treated with a licensed drug, Aliqopa, that has previously been shown to have limited effects in such patients. However, recent animal studies, including a paper this week in Nature from Mukherjee’s lab, suggest its effectiveness could be significantly boosted when combined with diet changes aimed at lowering insulin levels.

To achieve this, patients will be put on a so-called ketogenic diet (high in fat, low in carbohydrate, normal protein). “If you combine them with a diet which [keeps insulin low], all of a sudden these drugs become effective,” said Mukherjee, referring to the Nature study. “The diet really works like a drug.”

The team arrived at the idea after being involved in trials of drugs that, like Bayer’s Aliqopa, were designed to target one of the most common cancer mutations, called PI3K, that is present in up to 40% of breast cancers.

Despite major pharmaceutical industry investment a decade ago, none of the drugs aimed at PI3K have a major impact on survival rates. “There was an enormous amount of hype around these drugs, huge investments of the order of billions of dollars,” said Mukherjee.

Mukherjee and colleagues noticed that a high proportion of patients on one of the original trials had become diabetic, and after initially dismissing this as a drug side-effect, they began to investigate. They discovered the drug was interfering with one of the body’s main metabolic circuits, causing a spike in insulin production, which had the effect of reactivating the mutated genetic pathway that was helping cancer cells proliferate and spread.

“It may be the central reason we don’t get effectiveness,” said Mukherjee.

The trial will be among the first to investigate whether diet can be used to boost the effectiveness of drugs, but others are expected to follow in the next few years.

“There’s been so much over many, many years in terms of diet and what you should and shouldn’t eat to help in terms of cancer therapy,” said Prof Karen Vousden, Cancer Research UK’s chief scientist, based at the Francis Crick Institute in London and a member of the international working group. “There’s a lot of black magic and old wives’ tales. None of it is really based on any evidence.”

In some cases, Vousden added, what might intuitively seem correct – giving patients on chemotherapy a sugary drink, say – might not be the optimal way to boost calorie intake. “We want to champion the idea that you give dietary advice based on hard evidence,” she said.

Vousden’s work has shown that cancer cells are disproportionately dependent on dietary sources of an amino acid called serine. Healthy cells can produce their own serine, but cancer cells are less capable of doing this, and animal studies have shown that cutting dietary intake of the substance makes cancer more vulnerable to drugs.

Serine is present in most dietary protein, so if clinical evidence supported such an intervention in the future, this might mean patients being placed on an extremely low-protein diet, supplemented with a serine-free protein shake.

Siddhartha Mukherjee: 'A positive attitude does not cure cancer, any more than a negative one causes it' Read more

Both Vousden and Mukherjee say they would discourage patients from putting themselves on diets after reading about the latest findings. There is no evidence that the ketogenic diet, for instance, would be helpful on its own – in fact, for leukaemia it appeared to accelerate the disease’s progress.

“We are not suggesting that people go out there and self-medicate with these diets,” said Vousden. “We’re looking at it more from the way we’d look at any other drug.”

Prof Greg Hannon, director of the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute, recently discovered that a compound found in asparagus called asparagine appears to drive the spread of cancer. The study, in mice, showed that animals with breast cancer had a dramatically reduced rate of secondary tumours when asparagine was either blocked using a drug or cut from the diet.

“The holy grail is finding something that cancer cells are uniquely dependent on,” said Hannon. “By depriving them of that resource it makes them more vulnerable to things that we already use to treat patients.”

There is no suggestion that cancers have been caused by a diet in the first place. “We’re looking to attack peculiarities in cancer cells, but an imbalanced diet would not have caused those peculiarities to be there in the first place,” said Hannon.",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2924b8fd529902e843ddd094880f56ac2dd7f335/0_204_5976_3584/master/5976.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvZDM1ODZhNWVmNTc4MTc1NmQyMWEzYjYzNWU1MTcxNDEvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc=&s=040d32126b9d1031cbcbcd08a7a2c891,[],https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jul/06/top-oncologist-to-study-effect-of-diet-on-cancer-drugs,2018-07-06T18:00:06
Chris Brown arrested after Florida show,['Ben Beaumont-Thomas'],"The R&B star Chris Brown has been arrested in Florida on a charge of felony battery.

On Thursday the singer and rapper performed a concert on his Heartbreak on a Full Moon tour in West Palm Beach, Florida, and was arrested shortly afterwards. He was taken to the nearby Palm Beach county jail, and was released on bail of $2,000 (£1,500). It is not yet clear who has accused him, and no more details are yet available about the incident.

Alongside a career that has included seven US top-five albums, and hits such as Run It, No Air and Loyal, Brown has been apprehended numerous times by police. Most famously, in 2009 he attacked his then girlfriend Rihanna, leaving her bruised and bleeding. “I really hit her, with a closed fist, I punched her ... that’s going to haunt me forever,” he said in a recent documentary.

In October 2013, he was arrested on an assault charge after being accused of punching a man who tried to have his photo taken with Brown, later pleading guilty to the incident. The violation of his probation following the attack on Rihanna meant that he was sentenced to 131 days in jail, though was released early.

Another girlfriend, Karrueche Tran, won a five-year restraining order against Brown in 2017, alleging that he had threatened her with violence. In January 2016, a woman accused him of punching her in a Las Vegas nightclub, though Brown denied it and charges were dropped due to lack of evidence. In August 2016, an unidentified woman reported Brown to the Los Angeles police, saying he had threatened her with a gun at his house – he was released on $250,000 bail and has never faced trial over the incident.

In May 2018, he was sued by a woman who claimed she was raped at his home by one of his friends, Lowell Grissom Jr – the lawsuit is ongoing, though Brown’s lawyer has stated: “My investigation shows that none of these allegations are true.”",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70c63488779d414a365a1c133fc0cd8b51908c77/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvZDM1ODZhNWVmNTc4MTc1NmQyMWEzYjYzNWU1MTcxNDEvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc=&s=bedf36cb1a01384bb6aa3f28623d43f9,[],https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jul/06/chris-brown-arrested-florida-felony-battery,2018-07-06T17:02:03
JK Rowling attacked for saying Scottish nationalism 'contains traces of bigotry',['Alison Flood'],"Harry Potter author provokes an internet storm after tweeting that she was tired of ‘blood and soil nationalists marching with’ civic campaigners

JK Rowling has provoked the anger of Scottish nationalists by saying she is “mighty tired” of their “insistence that their nationalism is nothing like the other, nasty kinds, in the face of considerable evidence to the contrary”.

Rowling, who lives in Scotland, was responding to a column in the National by Lesley Riddoch that said: “Setting the English up as our automatic enemy doesn’t help us walk away from the Union mindset or its relentless pecking order. And yet like a packet of Crunchy Nut Cornflakes scoffed with cold milk late at night – it’s almost irresistible.”

Rowling described Riddoch’s quote as “Crunchy Nut nationalism”, tweeting: “Warning: may contain traces of bigotry.”

The Harry Potter author was asked by a Twitter user what made her think that Scottish nationalists are “xenophobic, racist or anti-English”, to which she posted a series of screenshots in response, including one from a user supporting the ethno-nationalist group Siol nan Gaidheal.

“When blood and soil ethno-nationalists are marching with your supposedly ‘civic’ marches, your nationalism doesn’t look too different to any other country,” wrote Rowling, who previously campaigned for Scotland to remain part of the UK and donated £1m to the Better Together campaign.

“Happy to take your word for it that such people aren’t representative of the entire movement. Happy to accept that the bulging folder of xenophobic and anglophobic screenshots I have on my laptop aren’t the whole story. But some of us are getting mighty tired of Scottish nationalist insistence that their nationalism is nothing like the other, nasty kinds.”

Along with a wave of criticism from Scottish nationalists on Twitter, the pro-nationalist paper the National also hit out at her comments, saying that Riddoch’s column actually “broadly agrees” with Rowling’s stance.

“We condemn all the views in those tweets, but the idea that such a tiny sample size is representative of the Yes movement is staggeringly wrong – particularly in the face of so many representing the opposite view,” the paper argued.

Citing Rowling’s criticism of Donald Trump’s politics, the editorial added: “How many ‘Scottish nationalists’ do you see on Twitter supporting Trump, relative to the number of Unionists who do? Which side’s politicians are loudest in condemning him? Scottish nationalism is nothing like that of Donald Trump.”",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd96ad935450345744ff7cef49e09dc0c7336b59/0_337_3164_1899/master/3164.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvZDM1ODZhNWVmNTc4MTc1NmQyMWEzYjYzNWU1MTcxNDEvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc=&s=bb723a3d2bbfb9e274f17fc97e3e6e90,[],https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/06/jk-rowling-attacked-for-saying-scottish-nationalism-contains-traces-of-bigotry,2018-07-06T14:16:40

Divorce on the rise in Iraq as wives cut ties to ISIS militants,[],"Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.

LONDON — When Umaima met her future husband 13 years ago, he was a car mechanic. Today, he is an Islamic State terrorist.

With ISIS driven from much of the territory it once controlled in Iraq and Syria, Umaima has joined a growing number of the militants' wives who are filing for divorce.

It wasn't an easy decision, Umaima said. Her community looks down on divorced women. She is also sad that her three children, aged 6 to 12, are growing up without a dad.

""I was and still am disappointed because I married a man who didn't appreciate his life and decided to join a terrorist group instead of taking care of his family,"" said Umaima, who is relying on the support of her parents as she navigates life as a single mother. ""I will try to be their father as well.""

Deputy Justice Minister Hussein Jassem said that there has been ""a huge increase"" in requests for divorce in the last three months across Iraq — with the vast majority filed by women.

While the government has not tracked the number of ISIS-related divorces, there has been a notable uptick in applications in Sunni Muslim regions such as Anbar and Nineveh where the group was strong, Jassem added.

Umaima said her husband's transformation came in 2010, after Iraqi security forces accused his brother of being a militant and fatally tortured him.

""My husband got mad and he swore he would take revenge on his brother's killers,"" Umaima told NBC News in a phone interview from Fallujah. Like other women NBC News spoke to, Umaima asked to be identified by only her first name out of fear of being stigmatized.

Her husband, Awad, joined ISIS after it swept across Iraq in 2014, Umaima said. He was later arrested and faces life in prison or a death sentence if convicted.

Despite the emotional hardship, Umaima, 41, said divorce is better than the alternative.

""Being the wife of a terrorist is not honoring me or my family and it is not going to honor my kids,"" she said.

While some conservative Sunni Muslim communities, including those where the women in this story live, are not in favor of divorce, it is accepted by many in Iraq and is not considered a sin under Islam. Both men and women can apply for divorce through the courts.

Iraqi women are free to request a divorce on a variety of grounds, including if their husband mistreated them or were convicted of crimes.

Spouses applying for a divorce have to provide evidence supporting their claims, such as sworn statements from witnesses. A case doesn't require a lawyer, is generally inexpensive and a decision is typically issued about a month after an application is filed.",https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_27/2486401/180704-mosul-women-mc-1020_bd2d3086013961e6b401c9e7ec98b81b.1200;630;7;70;5.JPG,[],https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/divorce-rise-iraq-wives-cut-ties-isis-militants-n888541,
Smoking hits all-time low in U.S.,[],"Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.

About 14 percent of U.S adults were smokers last year, down from about 16 percent the year before, government figures show.

There hadn’t been much change the previous two years, but it’s been clear there’s been a general decline and the new figures show it’s continuing, said K. Michael Cummings of the tobacco research program at Medical University of South Carolina.

“Everything is pointed in the right direction,” including falling cigarette sales and other indicators, Cummings said.

The new figures released Tuesday mean there are still more than 30 million adult smokers in the U.S., he added.

Teens are also shunning cigarettes. Survey results out last week showed smoking among high school students was down to 9 percent, also a new low.

In the early 1960s, roughly 42 percent of U.S. adults smoked. It was common nearly everywhere — in office buildings, restaurants, airplanes and even hospitals. The decline has coincided with a greater understanding that smoking is a cause of cancer, heart disease and other health problems.

Anti-smoking campaigns, cigarette taxes and smoking bans are combining to bring down adult smoking rates, experts say.

The launch of electronic cigarettes and their growing popularity has also likely played a role. E-cigarettes heat liquid nicotine into a vapor without the harmful by-products generated from burning tobacco. That makes them a potentially useful tool to help smokers quit, but some public health experts worry it also creates a new way for people to get addicted to nicotine.

There was no new information for adult use of e-cigarettes and vaping products, but 2016 figures put that at 3 percent of adults.

Vaping is more common among teens than adults. About 13 percent of high school students use e-cigarettes or other vaping devices.

The findings on adult smokers come from a national health survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 27,000 adults were interviewed last year.",https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_47/2236686/141230-smoking-cigarette-mn-1300_376ce25ce039d2ab607cbfa6c11a00eb.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg,[],http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/smoking-hits-all-time-low-u-s-n884621,

Scarlett Johansson faces firestorm amid news she will play a transgender man,[],"Scarlett Johansson is once again at the center of a casting controversy.

Johansson, who raised ire last year for playing a character originally written as Japanese, faced a new round of criticism this week amid reports that she would portray a real-life transgender man in an upcoming film.

The movie, ""Rub & Tug,"" is a crime drama based on the life of Dante ""Tex"" Gill, a trans man who police said operated a string of Pittsburgh massage parlors in the 1970s and 1980s that served as fronts for brothels.

The casting news provoked outrage on social media. LGBTQ activists and transgender performers were among the most vocal, expressing frustration that they seemed to be locked out of consideration for such roles.

""I wouldn't be as upset if I was getting in the same rooms as Jennifer Lawrence and Scarlett for cis[gender] roles, but we know that's not the case,"" transgender actress Trace Lysette tweeted. The term ""cisgender"" refers to people whose gender identity matches the sex they were assigned at birth.

""And not only do you play us and steal our narrative and our opportunity but you pat yourselves on the back with trophies and accolades for mimicking what we have lived,"" Lysette, who has a recurring role on the Amazon series ""Transparent,"" said in a subsequent tweet.

""I'm so done,"" she wrote, adding the state of affairs is ""so twisted.""

Johansson's representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment from NBC News. But in a statement to the website Bustle, the actress said via a representative: ""Tell them that they can be directed to Jeffrey Tambor, Jared Leto, and Felicity Huffman's reps for comment.""

That statement — itself the subject of controversy on social media, where it was widely seen as dismissive of concerns about ""Rub & Tug"" — referred to cisgender Hollywood stars who have earned critical acclaim for playing transgender characters.

Tambor won two Emmys for playing a trans woman on ""Transparent."" Leto took home an Academy Award for playing a trans woman in the 2013 movie ""Dallas Buyers Club."" Huffman got an Oscar nomination for playing a trans woman in the 2005 movie ""Transamerica.""

And yet Tambor, for one, has called on the entertainment industry to give more on-screen opportunities to transgender performers. (He left ""Transparent"" last year after Lysette and Van Barnes, a trans woman who was once Tambor's assistant, publicly accused him of sexual harassment.)

""Please give transgender talent a chance, give them auditions, give them their story,"" Tambor said in his Emmy acceptance speech in 2016. ""I would not be unhappy were I the last cisgender male to play a female transgender [person] on television.""

The firestorm around Johansson has also put fresh scrutiny on a 2003 obituary about Gill, published in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, that some contemporary readers saw as transphobic.

The obituary, referring to Gill with ""she/her"" pronouns, noted that Gill ""was always 'the woman who prefers to be known as a man,' or some variation of that description, and she sure looked and acted the part.""

It also states that Gill ""may even have undergone the initial stages of a sex change that made her appear masculine.""

""Rub & Tug"" is set to be helmed by Rupert Sanders, who also directed the 2017 adaptation of the Japanese manga franchise ""Ghost in the Shell."" In that movie, a commercial disappointment that drew accusations of ""whitewashing,"" Johansson played a cyborg whose name in the original comics is Major Motoko Kusanagi.

"Fewer teens having sex, doing drugs but more are depressed",[],"Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.

Fewer high school students are having sex than ever before, federal health officials reported Thursday. And they’re also less likely than some earlier generations to abuse drugs, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s annual survey on teen behavior finds.

But kids report that bullying at school is common and a third of students report persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness, the report finds. One in 10 girls and one out of 28 boys report they’ve been forced to have sex.

“Today’s youth are making better decisions about their health than just a decade ago,” said Dr. Jonathan Mermin, who directs CDC’s National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention.

“But, some experiences, such as physical and sexual violence, are outside their control and continue at painfully high levels. Their experiences today have powerful implications for their lives tomorrow.”

Every year, the CDC interviews several thousand students, choosing them to provide a nationally representative sample. The CDC cannot check whether the answers are accurate, but says the data these questionnaires generate is as acceptable as any self-reported data can be.

Condom use declining

In 2017, just 39.5 percent of the teenagers surveyed said they had ever had sex, down from 47.8 percent in 2007 and 57 percent in 1988.

Just under 10 percent said they had four or more sexual partners — something that puts people at higher risk of sexually transmitted infections such as HIV and gonorrhea. That compares to nearly 15 percent in 2007.

But barely over half had used a condom the last time they had sex, the survey found. That’s down significantly from 61 percent 10 years ago. Condoms are the only way to protect against most sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as gonorrhea and also protect against pregnancy and HIV.",https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_24/2465271/180614-high-school-students-al-1422_002530c3affd4b00f490c7172a2cc066.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg,[],http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fewer-teens-having-sex-doing-drugs-more-are-depressed-n883276,
Cardinal Theodore McCarrick removed from ministry after teen sex abuse claim,[],"Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.

Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, the former head of the Archdiocese of Washington, has been removed from public ministry by the Vatican following a ""credible and substantiated"" allegation of sexual abuse involving a teenager from nearly 50 years ago.

As the move was announced, Roman Catholic Church officials in New Jersey revealed that McCarrick, 87, also had been accused of sexual misconduct by adults three times in the past. Two of those accusations resulted in secret settlements, officials said.

In a written statement, McCarrick said he was ""shocked"" when he learned of the allegation involving a minor some months ago and supported a thorough investigation by the police and the Archdiocese of New York, where he was working as a priest when the abuse allegedly occurred.

""While I have absolutely no recollection of this reported abuse, and believe in my innocence, I am sorry for the pain the person who brought the charges has gone through, as well as for the scandal such charges cause our people,"" McCarrick said.

A well-known religious figure around the world, McCarrick is now one of the highest-ranking Americans in the church to be removed because of sex abuse allegations.

""In obedience I accept the decision of the Holy See, that I no longer exercise any public ministry,"" he said in the statement. ""I realize this painful development will shock my many friends, family members and people I have been honored to serve in my 60 years as a priest.""

"Video: Trump Slams ‘Dishonest, Fake’ Media For Using ‘Anonymous Sources’ To Smear Him","['Steve Watson', 'Infowars.Com -']","President Trump took a customary swipe at the media during a rally in Montana Thursday night, telling a huge crowd that his detractors in the media are “damn dishonest,” and describing them as “really bad people”.

“I see the way they write,” Trump bellowed.

“They’re so damn dishonest. And I don’t mean all of them. Because some of the finest people I know are journalists. Really. Hard to believe when I say that. I hate to say it but I have to say. But 75% of those people are downright dishonest. Downright dishonest.” the President continued.

Trump then specifically addressed the media’s use of the term ‘anonymous sources’ in articles and coverage designed to put him in a bad light.

“They’re fake. They’re fake,” he said. “They quote sources. ‘A source within the Trump organization said.’ A source. They don’t have a source. They never use names anymore”

“The old days, you have to use names. ‘Jim Smith said that Donald Trump is a bad guy.’ They don’t do that anymore. They say ‘a source within the administration.’” The President added.

“They make the sources up. They don’t exist in many cases. I saw one of them said 15 anonymous sources. I don’t have 15 people — forget it. 15 anonymous sources have said all source of stuff. These are really bad people.” Trump declared.

During the same rally, Trump addressed the protester who attempted to scale the Statue of Liberty on July 4th, prompting an evacuation. Trump called the protester a ‘clown’.

“You saw that clown yesterday on the Statue of Liberty, you saw those clowns that went up there,” Trump said, adding “I wouldn’t have done it.”

“I would have said let’s get some nets, we’ll wait ’til she….just get some nets,” he continued.

Trump also took a swipe at Elizabeth Warren, a potential 2020 opponent, saying that he’d provide her with a DNA test, to determine her ancestry.

“We will take that little kit and say — but we have to do it gently. It’s the ‘Me Too’ generation, so we have to be very gentle. And we will gently take the kit and slowly toss it, hoping it didn’t hit her and injure her arm. Even though it weighs only 2 ounces,” Trump said.

“And we will say we will give $1 million to your favorite charity, paid for by Trump, if you take the test and it shows you are an Indian.” the President added.

Dershowitz: Anti-Trump Woman Threatened to “Stab Me Through the Heart”,['Paul Joseph Watson'],"During an appearance on Tucker Carlson’s show last night, lawyer Alan Dershowitz revealed that a woman at a party in Martha’s Vineyard threatened to stab him in the heart because he doesn’t support impeaching Donald Trump.

“At a party this week on Martha’s Vineyard, a woman said if Dershowitz were here tonight, I’d stab him through the heart,” said the Harvard Law School professor.

“This is a Martha’s Vineyard woman saying she would stab me through the heart,” he emphasized.

The context of the discussion was how Dershowitz has been shunned by liberals, despite holding on to his classical liberal principles, simply because he doesn’t support the impeachment of Donald Trump. He was also attacked by MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough as being a puppet of Vladimir Putin.

The anecdote is another illustration of how the left’s hysterical tone in regard to the Trump administration’s policies is causing some on the left to speak and act out in unhinged ways.

Dershowitz went on to blame Professor Nicholas Negroponte for, “Leading the campaign to try to get other people to shun me in every way and not to engage with me,” before asserting that such individuals were “losing” because Americans “can’t stand people who try to stop speech and try to stop debate.”

“The Democrat Party has been taken over by radicals who have no interest in due process….they don’t want any dissent, they don’t want any argument,” said Dershowitz, adding that professors like Negroponte telling students not to engage with people they disagree with is a “terrible reflection of what’s going on in the United States of America.”

Dershowitz then challenged Scarborough to have him on his show, stating, “Let’s see if he has the guts to put me on his show so I can tell his viewers the truth.”

Korean Media: Pompeo to Give Kim Jong Un ‘Rocket Man’ CD from Trump,['Mikael Thalen'],"U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has brought to Pyongyang an Elton John CD featuring the song “Rocket Man” as a gift for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, South Korean media reports.

The idea for the gift, which has allegedly been autographed by U.S. President Donald Trump, came during the summit in Singapore last month when Kim revealed he had never heard the song, a diplomatic source in Washington told The Chosun Ilbo.

Trump, who also reportedly sent a letter for Kim alongside the CD, is said to have remembered the discussion prior to Pompeo’s departure Friday.

“Sources in Washington said the gifts reflect Trump’s expectations that Kim will follow through on the pledges in an agreement the two signed at their summit,” The Chosun Ilbo adds.

When asked about the alleged CD Friday, Pompeo declined to confirm or deny the gift’s existence to reports.

Pompeo and a U.S. delegation will spend two days in North Korea in an attempt to get Pyongyang to begin taking steps towards dismantling its nuclear program.

Although Kim agreed to “work towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” during last month’s summit, experts warn that the vague promise, similar to others made in the past, lacks specificity.

Commercial satellite imagery taken before and after the summit shows North Korea has continued to expand the Yongbyon Nuclear Research Facility and a key missile production site.

U.S. intelligence assessments also allege Pyongyang has continued to produce support equipment and launchers for one of its ballistic missiles as well as nuclear weapons fuel at multiple secret sites.

“Work is ongoing to deceive us on the number of facilities, the number of weapons, the number of missiles,” one U.S. official told NBC News.

When asked this week whether North Korea is trying to hide its nuclear weapons program, Trump suggested to reporters that only time will tell.

“We’ll see. We’ll see,” the president said. “All I can tell you is this. You haven’t had one missile launch and you haven’t had one rocket launch.”

“People were seen being taken away from the home, including at least one person covered by a blanket and led to a waiting car by unidentified people in plain clothes,” reported CBS San Francisco.

Nothing screams Democrat resistance as much as protesting ICE while they raid and break up a Child Sex Trafficking ring. The democrats are lost… all they have left is hate. #walkaway https://t.co/s1OSfWtaH2 — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 5, 2018

Oakland Police made it clear at the time that they did not participate in the investigation due to their Sanctuary City status, but did help with traffic control.

The August 2017 incident is receiving renewed scrutiny on social media as leftists continue to call for the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement federal agency to be abolished.

Oakland is the same Sanctuary City where Mayor Libby Schaff tipped off illegal aliens that ICE agents would be conducting raids in the community earlier this year. President Donald Trump later publicly dressed down Schaff, calling her actions a “disgrace.”

Pres. Trump says Oakland Mayor is being scrutinized following her decision to warn residents ahead of ICE raid: ""What she did is incredible, and very dangerous from the standpoint of ICE, and border patrol."" https://t.co/fmuC77lcM4 pic.twitter.com/LRddfTme0C — ABC News (@ABC) March 8, 2018

Italian Newspaper Claims ‘Global Elite’ Working to Transform Europe Through Mass Migration,[],"Italian writer Giampaolo Rossi has claimed that elites across Europe are attempting to change the nature of the continent by facilitating the mass migration of millions from Africa to Europe.

Mr Rossi cited a recent interview with Africa expert Stephen Smith who said that “within two generations, at least 100 million young Africans will be ready to come to Europe”, noting that 40 percent of Africans today are under the age of 15.

“This exodus will destabilise our societies,” Rossi writes in a post for his blog on Italian newspaper Il Giornale and notes that integration can take up to one or two generations.

Rossi blames the “globalist elite” claiming that people like Hungarian-born left-wing billionaire George Soros are behind the push for mass migration into Europe, calling the process the “Soros Plan”.

The term Soros Plan has been used before by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán who has successfully rallied against the influence of Mr Soros and his considerable network of civil society groups.

Trump to visit Windsor and Chequers on UK trip,[],"Image copyright EPA Image caption Melania Trump is joining her husband on the visit

Donald Trump will meet the Queen at Windsor and hold talks with the prime minister at Chequers on his two-day visit to the UK next week.

The itinerary for Thursday and Friday confirms the US president will stay at the US Ambassador's House in Regent's Park overnight.

But he will spend much of his time outside London at formal events.

Protests in the capital will go ahead as planned, organisers have said, with others set to demonstrate in Scotland.

BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins said it would be ""the most controversial visit ever made by an American president to Britain"".

Despite some pomp and ceremony, it will be ""far from the original state visit promised to President Trump"" and remains what is deemed a working trip, Robbins added.

Robbins said it was also ""really noticeable that he will barely spend any time in London"" - perhaps to avoid the protests.

But US ambassador to the UK, Woody Johnson, said there was no deliberate plan to keep Mr Trump out of the capital or away from protests, and he was ""focused on his objectives"".

He added that it was a ""short trip, packed with things he has to do"", but that President Trump ""will be spending a lot of time in central London"".

Groups organising protests on Friday have vowed to ""be heard"" whether he is in the capital or not.

President Trump will fly in to the UK on Thursday afternoon with First Lady Melania Trump, following a Nato summit in Brussels.

The couple will attend a black-tie dinner on Thursday hosted by Theresa May at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire - the birthplace of Sir Winston Churchill.

The president will be greeted with a military ceremony in the Great Court, with the bands of the Scots, Irish and Welsh Guards playing the Liberty Fanfare, Amazing Grace and the National Emblem.

Invited guests, including a number of business leaders, will eat dinner to the sounds of the Countess of Wessex's Orchestra, which will play a ""series of classic British and American hits"", according to Mrs May's deputy spokeswoman.

Mr Trump, whose mother was Scottish, will then be piped out at the end by the Royal Regiment of Scotland.

After spending the night at Winfield House in London, hosted by his ambassador Mr Johnson, the president will join the prime minister to watch a UK military exercise, before the pair travel to Chequers - the PM's country residence in Buckinghamshire - for bilateral talks.

The president and first lady will then travel to Windsor to meet the Queen on Friday afternoon.

On the final leg of the tour, the couple will fly to Scotland, where they plan to spend the weekend.

BBC diplomatic correspondent Robbins said while the government realises it is a controversial trip, President Trump is ""fully entitled"" to be welcomed into the UK in this way.

The government also stressed that previous presidents have met prime ministers at Chequers rather than at No 10, including Richard Nixon and both the Bushes.

US ambassador Mr Johnson said the ""special relationship"" between the UK and the US was ""as strong as ever"", and that Mr Trump knows the UK ""better than any other modern president"".

State visit?

Mrs May announced President Trump would be coming for a state visit to the UK in January 2017 after she became the first foreign leader to meet with him in Washington following his inauguration.

But after a lot of backlash from MPs and more than one million people signing a petition against the trip, a date has still not been set for the state visit.

Thousands are expected to protest in London on Thursday and Friday against the president's working visit.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan has granted permission for a giant inflatable figure depicting Mr Trump as a baby to fly over Westminster for two hours on the second day of the president's visit.

Daniel Jones, part of the group that organised the blow-up caricature, said he hoped Mr Trump would take note of their efforts online, even if he could not see it in person.

He added that, ""like it or not"", the government would not be able to ""smuggle"" the president around the country ""without him seeing anything"".

Amesbury Novichok contaminated item search continues,[],"Image copyright Facebook Image caption Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley fell ill on Saturday in Amesbury, Wiltshire

Police in hazmat suits have entered a hostel in Salisbury as they search for the item contaminated with the nerve agent that poisoned a couple.

Investigators in protective clothing began searching John Baker House, where one of the victims, Dawn Sturgess, 44, lives, on Friday afternoon.

Police believe Charlie Rowley, 45, and Ms Sturgess were exposed to Novichok after handling the unknown object.

The pair remain in a critical condition in hospital.

The item was unlikely to have been left in the open before they touched it, a government scientist has told BBC News.

BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford said the search for the item could take ""weeks or months"" and that no objects have yet been collected for testing.

Novichok can be degraded by rainwater and sunlight over time - meaning it was probably discovered by the pair in a contained space, the government scientist said.

But other experts have said the nerve agent was designed to be persistent and not break down.

Image copyright PA Image caption Police in hazmat suits have searched the Salisbury hostel where one of the victims lives

Speaking to BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner, the government scientist said the Novichok was so toxic it was able to pass through the skin and did not need to be ingested.

The source added that Mr Rowley and Ms Sturgess's symptoms were the same as those shown by Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia.

They were both poisoned with Novichok in nearby Salisbury in March.

Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat said the latest incident was a result of a ""war crime"" by Russia - and that using a nerve agent in a civilian area was a ""vile act of terror"".

But Russia - which denies involvement in either incident - said the UK was trying to ""muddy the waters"" and ""intimidate its own citizens"".

Who are the victims?

Ms Sturgess is understood to be a mother of three who lives at the Salisbury hostel, which offers supported accommodation.

A close friend of Ms Sturgess's, who also lived at John Baker House, described her as a ""loving and caring person"".

Mr Rowley's brother Matthew told the BBC: ""He's a lovely guy and would do anything for you. He's a sweetheart basically.""

What happened to them?

On Saturday, paramedics were called twice to a flat in Muggleton Road in Amesbury - first at 11:00 BST after Ms Sturgess collapsed.

Medics attended again several hours later, after Mr Rowley also fell ill.

A friend of the couple, Sam Hobson, said after Ms Sturgess was taken to hospital, he and Mr Rowley went to a chemist in Amesbury to collect a prescription before going to an event at a nearby Baptist church.

The two men returned to the flat and planned to visit the hospital but Mr Rowley ""started feeling really hot and sweaty"" and began ""acting all funny"", Mr Hobson, 29, said.

""He was rocking against the wall and his eyes were red, pinpricked, and he started sweating loads and dribbling, so I had to phone an ambulance for him,"" said Mr Hobson.

Based on information from a friend and items found at the flat, Wiltshire Police initially thought the pair had fallen ill after using a contaminated batch of heroin or crack cocaine.

But after tests at the government's military research facility at Porton Down, a major incident was declared and it was confirmed they had been exposed to Novichok.

What are the police investigating?

Image caption At midday on Friday, there was an increased police presence in Muggleton Road - where the couple were found - with fire engines also attending.

Police do not believe Mr Rowley and Ms Sturgess were victims of a targeted attack, but instead came into contact with the substance in Amesbury or Salisbury.

Home Secretary Sajid Javid said the ""strong working assumption"" was that the pair came into contact with Novichok in a location which had not been cleaned up following the Skripal poisoning.

Assistant Commissioner of Specialist Operations Neil Basu said that ""around 100 detectives"" from the Counter Terrorism Policing Network were working on the investigation.

Five areas have been cordoned off: Muggleton Road, Boots pharmacy and the Baptist church in Ambesbury; John Baker House and Queen Elizabeth Gardens in Salisbury.

What has the government said?

Mr Javid called on Russia to explain ""exactly what has gone on"".

The home secretary added he was ""comfortable"" the ""exact same nerve agent"" had been used in both the Salisbury and Amesbury poisonings - but added it was not yet known if they were from the same batch.

Mr Tugendhat, chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said responsibility for the incident ""lies pretty clearly in the Kremlin, who are willing to use a persistent nerve agent among civilian communities"".

In response to Mr Javid's comments, Russia said the British government was subjecting them ""to hell"".

Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova urged police not to be led by the ""dirty political game"" and said she was confident the UK would have to apologise to Russia.

Russian newspapers have also been following developments. ""Return of wandering Novichok"" is the headline in Moskovsky Komsomolets, in an article which says the UK is ""incapable of ensuring security of its citizens"" and Russia is the ""one to blame for anything"".

Meanwhile, the Rossiyskaya Gazeta says the poisoning could have been a ""consequence of the Porton Down staff losing vigilance"".

Venus Williams beaten by Kiki Bertens in Wimbledon third round,[],"Media playback is not supported on this device Venus Williams is the latest top seed out of the tournament

Five-time Wimbledon champion Venus Williams became the eighth of the top 10 seeds to be knocked out after a third-round defeat by Kiki Bertens.

Ninth seed Williams, 38, was beaten 6-2 6-7 (5-7) 8-6 by the 26-year-old Dutchwoman on Court One.

Williams' fellow American Madison Keys lost nine consecutive games in her defeat to qualifier Evgeniya Rodina.

The 10th seed lost 7-5 5-7 6-4 in two hours 10 minutes against the Russian, who is ranked 120th in the world.

However, younger sister Serena to reach the last 16.

Venus Williams made a sluggish start to the contest and her body language in the first set belied her frustration.

At 5-1 Williams, who won Wimbledon in 2000, 2001, 2005, 2007 and 2008, saved a set point on her serve to avoid being broken for a third time.

However, 20th seed Bertens remained unflustered and clinically closed out the set with an ace.

World number nine Williams eventually found some rhythm in the second set as the pair twice traded breaks - Beterns missing a chance to serve out for the match at 5-4 up.

In the tie-break that followed, Williams won two mini breaks to have a 6-2 advantage only to fluff a chance to close out the set before she eventually levelled the match.

The pair exchanged early breaks in the third set before Bertens squandered two break points in the eighth game as Williams held.

Williams saved two match break points on deuce at 7-6 down, but the pressure told and she struck a return low into the net to hand Bertens the victory in two hours and 40 minutes.

Keys cut down by Rodina

Keys, 23, had seemingly been cruising to the first set at 5-2 up only for the momentum to dramatically swing back to unheralded Russian Rodina.

The world number 11 made numerous unforced errors which allowed 29-year-old Rodina to come back into the match and take the first set.

Keys continued to struggle early in the second set as her losing streak of games continued and at 4-0 down the match appeared Rodina's for the taking.

However, the American suddenly rediscovered her mojo and produced a superb fightback to win the second set.

Rodina received lengthy treatment from the physio early in the third set and did not move around the court as freely.

Both players regularly exchanged breaks in a scrappy third set, before Rodina kept her nerve at 5-4 up to reach the fourth round of a Grand Slam for the first time in her career.

Ekaterina Makarova, who knocked out second seed Caroline Wozniacki in the third round, also progressed.

The 30-year-old Russian beat Lucie Safarova of the Czech Republic 4-6 6-4 6-1 to seal her place in the last 16.

Brexit: May bids to unite cabinet behind plan,[],"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Chequers and Brexit - what's going on at the country retreat?

Cabinet ministers are meeting at Chequers in a bid to thrash out an agreement on the shape of the UK's future relationship with the EU.

Theresa May has said they have ""a duty"" to reach agreement on Friday, amid splits over how closely the UK should stick to EU rules after Brexit.

She is expected to propose keeping the UK aligned with the EU on trading rules for goods but not services.

An ex-minister warned that would mean ""something less than the full Brexit"".

If ministers reach an agreement, the EU can then choose to accept or reject their proposals.

Speaking on Friday, the EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said it was ""ready to adapt our offer should the UK's red lines change"" but insisted there could be no ""unravelling"" of the single market.

Ministers are expected to be at Chequers, a 16th Century house in Buckinghamshire which is the PM's country residence, until about 22.00 GMT. They had to hand in their phones and any smartwatches on arrival.

Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said the proposal would include a common rulebook on some sectors - like industrial goods and agricultural goods - for ""practical"" supply chain reasons.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I'm pretty confident we will end up with a concrete position which everybody is able to sign up to.""

Image copyright Downing Street Image caption Cabinet ministers are expected to be in talks at Chequers all day

But Brexiteer ministers are understood to be unhappy. Seven cabinet ministers met at the Foreign Office on Thursday evening to discuss the proposal.

There have also been suggestions that the prime minister's proposal would make a US trade deal more difficult. No 10 says it is ""categorically untrue that we will not be able to strike a trade deal with the US"".

David Jones, a former minister at the Department for Exiting the EU, said Mrs May's proposal looked set to breach her ""red lines"" on leaving the customs union, single market and jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.

How much danger is Theresa May in?

Image caption Between meetings, the PM and other ministers took a breath of fresh air

BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg

If this was easy, Theresa May would not need the cloistered environment of Chequers to get her cabinet to agree. She would not need the tranquil quiet of the Buckinghamshire countryside to broker peace.

She is vulnerable because her plan is hardly Brexit to some of those who campaigned to leave.

Vulnerable in her party because her authority is in short supply and there is intense disagreement. Vulnerable then in Parliament because without a majority, a small faction can wreak havoc on either side.

Ahead of the meeting, Mrs May said the cabinet had ""a great opportunity - and a duty. To set an ambitious course to enhance our prosperity and security outside the European Union - and to build a country that genuinely works for everyone"".

Labour's Sir Keir Starmer said a workable agreement that could be taken to the EU was needed and ""simply a truce in the cabinet was not good enough for Britain"".

Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said time was running out for the UK and the worst outcome would be ministers emerging ""arm in arm, saying they've agreed, because that means there's another helping of fudge being served up and what is being put forward is likely to be rejected by Europe"".

Image copyright Matthew Stockman Image caption Boris Johnson is said to have met former Prime Minister David Cameron on Thursday

Meanwhile sources close to David Cameron confirmed the former PM met Boris Johnson on Thursday and discussed Brexit.

But they said there was ""no grand view"" on the negotiations and disputed reports Mr Cameron had agreed that Theresa May's plan was the ""worst of all worlds"".

Why is the summit happening?

Image copyright PA Image caption The UK has been told to ""lay its cards on the table""

There have been differing views within the cabinet about how closely the UK should stick to EU rules after Brexit, and what compromises should be made to achieve ""as frictionless as possible"" trade.

The aim is to agree a UK proposal on how future relations should work on Friday, the details of which would then be published in a White Paper net week.

That would then be the subject of negotiations with the EU - which might have different ideas.

What does the cabinet need to agree on?

Image copyright PA Image caption Under standard cabinet protocol, ministers had to hand in their phones before the meeting started

Ministers have yet to agree what they want to replace the UK's membership of the EU's customs union, which allows for tariff-free trading between members.

One of the key issues is the need to avoid new border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland when the UK is outside the customs union.

The EU and UK say there can be no return to a hard border. But Eurosceptic MPs say tying the UK to the EU after it leaves will prevent it from striking its own trade deals with other countries.

Meanwhile 46 other Conservative MPs have urged Mrs May to listen to businesses and target a deal which enables ""frictionless trade to continue"".

What is the proposed trade plan being discussed?

The ""facilitated customs arrangement"" is understood to be a proposal for a post-Brexit customs agreement which would allow the UK the freedom to set its own tariffs on goods arriving into the country.

Technology would be used to determine where the goods will ultimately end up - and therefore whether UK or EU tariffs should be paid.

It would keep the UK aligned to EU regulations in some sectors- such as industrial and agricultural goods - but Parliament would be able to decide where to deviate.

The 120-page plan is also understood to propose an end to the free movement of people but to say the UK would have to accept the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in some areas.

Details of how the plan would work in practice have yet to be published. But Downing Street says it is confident the arrangement would be partly in place by the end of the proposed transition period in December 2020 - with the system being fully operational by the next general election, due in 2022.

It is not clear whether the EU will agree to it.

Why now?

The UK is due to leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on 29 March 2019.

But to allow time for parliaments in the UK and the EU to approve whatever deal is agreed, the aim is for the framework for future relations to be agreed this autumn.

Syria war: Douma attack was chlorine gas,[],"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Patients, including children, were hosed down with water to remove chemicals on their skin

A chemical weapons watchdog has found that chlorine gas was used in April's attack on the Syrian city of Douma.

The interim report by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said ""various chlorinated organic chemicals"" had been found but there was no evidence of nerve agents.

Dozens of civilians were killed in the attack on the rebel-held town in the Eastern Ghouta region near Damascus.

The Syrian government denies carrying out any chemical weapons attacks.

Following the Douma attack, US, British and French warplanes launched strikes against government military targets.

Medics in Douma reported on 7 April that more than 500 patients had been brought to medical facilities with symptoms suggesting exposure to a chemical agent.

Rescue workers also reported a strong smell of chlorine in the air following an air strike that targeted two locations in Douma.

The OPCW sent a fact-finding mission to Douma about a week later.

""Along with explosive residues, various chlorinated organic chemicals were found in samples from two sites,"" the preliminary report said.

""Work by the team to establish the significance of these results is on-going. The FFM (fact-finding mission) team will continue its work to draw final conclusions.""

The report said two samples from gas cylinders recovered at the scene tested positive for chlorine.

Following the attack, a UN investigation said evidence pointed to the use of chlorine but that some people had exhibited symptoms more consistent with exposure to a nerve agent.

The OPCW report, however, said that ""no organophosphorous nerve agents or their degradation products were detected"" at the sites.

The five-year siege of the Eastern Ghouta, an agricultural region outside the capital where at least 265,000 civilians lived, was the longest in modern history.

It came to an end in April, after a two-month offensive by pro-government forces, backed by Russian air strikes, that decimated homes, businesses and hospitals and reportedly left more than 1,700 men, women and children dead.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F56A/production/_100762826_mediaitem100762825.jpg,[],https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-44746147,2018-07-06T18:43:35
China and Russia hit back at Trump tariffs,[],"Image copyright Reuters Image caption US lobsters are among goods subject to Chinese retaliatory tariffs

China and Russia have hit back after US tariffs on Chinese goods came into effect and President Donald Trump threatened to impose more.

China's commerce ministry said it had lodged a new complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO).

Meanwhile, Russia said it would introduce extra duties on a range of products imported from the US.

Beijing has accused the US of starting the ""largest trade war in economic history"".

What tariffs are now in effect?

US tariffs on $34bn (£25.7bn) of Chinese goods came into effect on Friday.

China retaliated by imposing a similar 25% tariff on 545 US products - including cars, soya beans and lobsters - also worth a total of $34bn.

Russia is introducing extra duties on a range of products imported from the US that can be replaced by locally made equivalents.

They include road-building equipment, products for the oil and gas industry, and tools used in mining.

Mr Trump has already imposed tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels, and started charging levies on the imports of steel and aluminium from the European Union, Mexico and Canada.

The US tariffs imposed so far would affect the equivalent of 0.6% of global trade and account for 0.1% of global GDP, according to Morgan Stanley.

What is President Trump threatening?

The US president said America might target Chinese goods worth $500bn - the total value of Chinese imports in 2017.

The White House had previously said it would consult on tariffs on another $16bn of products, which Mr Trump has suggested could come into effect later this month.

Mr Trump said: ""You have another 16 [billion dollars] in two weeks, and then, as you know, we have $200bn in abeyance and then after the $200bn, we have $300bn in abeyance. OK? So we have 50 plus 200 plus almost 300.""

Behind the trade war, there is conflict within the Trump administration. Hardliners such as Peter Navarro, a trade policy adviser, says the US is defending itself against an ""aggressive"" China. Meanwhile, some of the officials who previously worked for the Obama administration - known as ""holdovers"" - are hoping to tamp down the US-China conflict.

The tension between these factions is occasionally on display in the West Wing. I've seen two hardliners struggle over a podium, vying for a chance to broadcast Trump's harsh message on economic issues, while the holdovers sit quietly at the side of the room.

This reflects a larger division in the White House: Trump and his closest aides are trying to bring about radical change, while those who support a more cautious approach find themselves sitting in silence.

What do China and Russia say?

""Trade war is never a solution,"" said Chinese Premier Li Keqiang. ""China would never start a trade war, but if any party resorts to an increase of tariffs then China will take measures in response to protect development interests.""

The government-run English language China Daily newspaper said: ""The Trump administration is behaving like a gang of hoodlums with its shakedown of other countries, particularly China.""

Russia says US tariffs on steel and aluminium, introduced in March, will cost its companies more than half a billion dollars.

Will there be a full-scale trade war?

Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch forecast only a modest escalation in the US-China battle, adding: ""However, we can't rule out a full-blown, recession-inducing 'trade war'.""

Rob Carnell, chief Asia economist at ING, said: ""This is not economic Armageddon. We will not have to hunt our food with pointy sticks.

""But it is applying the brakes to a global economy that has less durable momentum than appears to be the case.""

Carmaker BMW said it could not absorb all of the 25% tariff on the cars it exports to China from a plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina and would have to raise prices.

The new tariffs had little impact on Asian stock markets. The Shanghai Composite closed 0.5% higher, but ended the week 3.5% lower - its seventh consecutive week of losses.

Tokyo closed 1.1% higher and European markets were up more than 1% in morning trading before turning negative on Friday afternoon.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/E25F/production/_102415975_mediaitem102415974.jpg,[],https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-44742714,2018-07-06T17:35:36
Three YouTube vloggers die in waterfall plunge at Canada's Shannon Falls,[],"Image copyright High On Life Image caption Photos of the trio were posted on a GoFundMe page

Three members of a YouTube travel blogging collective have died after falling over a waterfall in Canada.

Ryker Gamble, Alexey Lyakh and Megan Scraper were part of High On Life, who post videos of their travel adventures.

The group said: ""They were three of the warmest, kindest and most driven and outgoing people you could ever meet.""

Police said the trio were swimming at the top of Shannon Falls in British Columbia on Tuesday when they ""slipped and fell into a pool 30m (98ft) below"".

Other members of the group, who have 1.1 million followers on Instagram and more than 500,000 YouTube subscribers, named the three on their memorial fund page and in a tribute video.

They said: ""There are truly no words that can be said to ease the pain and the devastation we are all going through right now.""

According to the Vancouver Sun, the accident happened when Scraper slipped and fell, with Gamble and Lyakh also getting swept away as they tried to save her.

High On Life are based in Vancouver and were formed by Gamble, Lyakh and another high school friend, Parker Heuser, after they travelled the world in 2012.

They decided to turn travel and video production into a full-time job and often promoted brands and destinations in the pictures and videos they posted from exotic locations.

Their Facebook page says: ""High On Life is the attitude to embrace all of life's opportunities with a positive outlook and energy.""

In one of his last Instagram posts, Gamble, spoke about the things we can all learn from ""our younger selves"".

He wrote: ""Life isn't about responsibilities, tough decisions and hard work, it's about feeling bliss and living in the moment.""

Skip Twitter post by @YesTheory So heart broken and stunned to hear about the passing of Ryker, Alexey from @sundayfundayz along with Alexey's girlfriend, Megan. We watched High On Life for inspiration when we were just starting..so much love, joy and adventure. May they rest in peace <3 — Yes Theory (@YesTheory) July 6, 2018 Report

Last year, Gamble, Lyakh and another group member, Justis Price Brown, were banned from US federal land for five years after pleading guilty to walking on a sensitive hot spring in Yellowstone National Park and other crimes at parks across the western US.

In a statement released on Wednesday, Royal Canadian Mounted Police said they had received a call about three people swimming in one of the pools at the top of Shannon Falls, about 36 miles (58km) north of Vancouver.

""The individuals were with a group of friends when they slipped and fell into a pool 30 metres below,"" they said.

They added that teams had ""worked throughout the day to complete the complex recovery of all three people from Shannon Falls"" and that the file had been given to the coroner's office.

The British Columbia Coroners Service said on Friday they were in the early stages of the investigation.

An official confirmed the three were in their 20s, though Gamble's age has been reported as 30.

The Shannon Falls region and its old growth forests are an increasingly popular destination to visit in the province.

The waterfalls themselves are among of the tallest in British Columbia, reaching 1,009ft (335m) at their highest point.

In the wake of the tragedy, officials are warning people to be cautious in the area.

""Areas like Shannon Falls have very polished granite, it's very slippery with the mist and the lichen and etcetera that builds up around there-going in or near those pools has great risk,"" John Wilcox with Squamish Search and Rescue told radio station News 1130 on Wednesday.

""It's a very unfortunate circumstance hopefully we can all learn from.""

Supermarkets recall frozen vegetables over listeria fears,[],"Image copyright AGF Image caption The recall includes bags of frozen sweetcorn and frozen mixed vegetables

Supermarkets have recalled bags of frozen vegetables over fears they could contain a deadly bacteria.

The 43 sweetcorn-based products have been withdrawn by major supermarket supplier Greenyard Frozen UK.

The Food Standards Agency said the veg may contain listeria monocytogenes which can cause listeriosis, a rare illness responsible for the death of two people in the UK last year.

Own-brand products for Tesco, Aldi and Sainsbury's are among those affected.

A list of the 43 products recalled from UK supermarkets, which also include some from Lidl, Iceland and Waitrose, has been posted on the Food Standards Agency (FSA) website.

Greenyard Frozen UK, based in King's Lynn, Norfolk, has been approached for comment.

The FSA said the recall was a ""precautionary measure"".

It advised anyone who has bought the products to not eat them and to ""return the product to the store from where it was bought for a full refund"".

According to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) 11 people in the UK have been affected by listeriosis since 2015, including two people who died last year.

What is listeria?

The listeria bacteria can develop into the rare but serious listeriosis illness

It has symptoms that are similar to flu, including high temperature, muscle ache, sickness and diarrhoea

It can be more serious for people with weakened immune systems and also the elderly, pregnant women and infants

Earlier this week, the FSA said frozen sweetcorn and other frozen vegetables were the likely source of the outbreak in five countries, including the UK.

It advised consumers that most frozen vegetables need to be cooked before eating, in line with manufacturers' instructions.

The EFSA said listeria has been affecting Austria, Denmark, Finland, Sweden and the UK since 2015.

To date, 47 cases and nine deaths have been reported.

The same strain of listeria was detected in frozen vegetables produced by a Hungarian company in 2016, 2017 and 2018, the EFSA said.

It added: ""This suggests that the strains have persisted in the processing plant despite the cleaning and disinfection procedures that were carried out.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/14B5/production/_102410350_capture.png,[],https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-44739472,2018-07-06T14:32:50
LAPD Has No Additional Info Six Months After Alleged ‘Racist Graffiti’ at LeBron James’ Home,['Breitbart News'],"A year ago NBA star LeBron James reported to the media that he suffered “racist graffiti” spray painted on his Los Angeles mansion. But to date, the L.A. Police still have no information about the case.

In May of last year, James told the media that his $21 million Brentwood home was attacked with racist graffiti. At the time Captain Patricia Sandoval of the L.A. Police Department reported that James was not home during the incident, but they were investigating.

An unknown person allegedly defaced the player’s front gate with the N-word and police said they are investigating the vandalism as a possible hate crime.

The left-leaning sports media immediately decried the incident as proof of racism in America. The investigation has been going on for months, but no new information has come to light for six months. Since nothing has been said of the crime recently, Clay Travis of Outkick the Coverage decided to contact the L.A.P.D. for a follow up. And, Travis noted that the department’s reply was “pretty eye-opening.”

The L.A.P.D. sent Travis a statement saying:

Good afternoon and thank you for your inquiry. We have heard no further with regards to that incident since it happened back in May of this year. I know detectives were investigating, but no further was provided to us. Usually, with something high profile or newsworthy, we are provided follow up information to give out to the media when it’s available. Check back with us.

Travis went on to insist that with no further information emerging from this investigation, it may be time to start wondering if any crime really happened in the first place.

After all, the story so far is somewhat suspect, Travis hinted. We know that police were called to the mansion, but the gates had already been repainted before they got there. We know that neither James nor any member of his family was at home at the time. We also know that the police were given a photo of the supposed graffiti, but police have no other proof that it occurred or any hint of who might have done it. Finally, the surveillance cameras at the home were not working so there is no video of the supposed attack.

Travis asked a series of probing questions about the report, but in the end, it all sounds rather fantastic to him.

“Six months after the sports media turned an alleged racial slur painted onto a gate outside LeBron’s gate into the top story in America,” Travis wrote, “there is still zero public evidence it actually happened, and the Los Angeles police have provided no public statement about their investigation.

“That should seem strange to anyone who follows stories like these,” he said. “It just doesn’t make sense.”

Taxpayers Fund ‘Study’ Linking Trump Support to Opioid Abuse,['Breitbart News'],"A study published by the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) and funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has concluded that “chronic use of prescription opioid drugs was correlated with support for the Republican candidate in the 2016 US presidential election.”

Researchers led by principal investigator James S. Goodwin, M.D., the George and Cynthia Mitchell distinguished chair of geriatric medicine at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, Texas, set out to answer the question “To what extent do socioeconomic measurements explain the county-level association of the 2016 US Republican presidential vote with opioid use?”

Using a national sample of Medicare claims data, the researchers observed:

Counties and states with the highest opioid use were often areas carried by the Republican candidate in the election. This is not surprising, because aspects of the narrative analyzing the presidential vote echoed themes that occur in explanations for high opioid use.

The authors drew the conclusion that support for Trump “is a marker for physical conditions, economic circumstances, and cultural forces associated with opioid use.”

“The findings of this study add to the emerging literature on the relationship between health status and support of Donald Trump in the 2016 election,” they write.

The paper has drawn criticism from various physicians and groups regarding its political motivation and the fact that it was funded by a grant from NIH for cancer research.

Dr. James P. Murphy, a Kentucky physician who is past president of the Greater Louisville Medical Society, tweeted about the paper, “Seriously, is this a practical joke?”:

Well, @JAMA_current has officially jumped the shark – linking the #opioidcrisis to voting #Republican! Seriously, is this a practical joke? Regardless of your political leanings, I expect a higher standard from @AmerMedicalAssn. #opioidhysteria @AAPSonline https://t.co/rTjnftQAvT — Confluential Truth (@jamespmurphymd) June 28, 2018

The Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS) called out NIH for diverting taxpayer funds for potential cancer research to politically motivated, anti-Trump research:

NIH cancer research dollars diverted on ""study"" linking Trump support to opioid use? https://t.co/QhEufpEHoO — AssocAmerPhys&Surg (@AAPSonline) June 29, 2018

Similarly, a blog post at the website of Independent Physicians for Patient Independence (IP4PI), a group of doctors who support the elimination of government and health insurance interference in patient care, observed:

The venerable Journal of the American Medical Association is out with a new NIH-funded “original investigation.” What medical breakthroughs are being announced do you ask? Not. A. Single. One. Instead JAMA has published a “study” the authors tout as “adding to the emerging literature on the relationship between health status and support of Donald Trump in the 2016 election.” You read that right. Trump supporters are more likely to abuse drugs, according to Dr. Goodwin and his colleagues. However, reading through the article, it becomes clear that the boldness of their claim is inversely proportional to the strength of the evidence backing it up. It’s bad enough that the researchers are digging through and torturing medical data (statistically) for a political purpose. It’s equally bad that the patient data was used without any informed consent (because the data is “de-identified” don’t ya know). What’s worse? A source of funding for this junk science appears to be a taxpayer funded NIH grant ostensibly for cancer prevention and control.

Left-wing media touted the study’s results.

“Regions with Highest Opioid Use Strongly Backed Trump In 2016, Study Finds” was the headline HuffPost reported. “In 693 counties with ‘significantly higher’ than average rates of opioid prescriptions, Trump won about 60 percent of the vote.”

“Medicare data indicate that voters in areas that went for Trump weren’t just hurting economically — many of them were receiving prescriptions for opioid painkillers,” said National Public Radio (NPR).

In an interview with NPR, Goodwin said that, in reviewing places hardest hit by opioid abuse and those with strong Trump support, “there was a clear overlap between counties that had high opioid use … and the vote for Donald Trump.”

“There were blogs from various people saying there was this overlap,” Goodwin added. “But we had national data.”

However, when Breitbart News questioned Goodwin about the use of NIH cancer research funding for the study and its purpose, he said in an email conversation that the study was “misunderstood.”

“Several individuals had already shown the correlation between the 2016 presidential vote and various health indicators, like opioid use, or mortality rates,” he said and added, “What some of reporters were doing was saying people who take opioids voted for Trump. That is a fundamental misinterpretation of our findings. What we showed was that people who lived in areas affected by the opioid epidemic (as indicated by high opioid use) voted for Trump. An analogy would be if someone reported that people who live in high crime areas voted for the “law and order” candidate for sheriff. That doesn’t mean the criminals voted for the law and order candidate. Using that kind of ecologic analysis (the term for looking at traits by area, not individual levels) can NEVER say anything about the characteristics of individuals.”

Goodwin did not address Breitbart News’s questions about the NIH funding for the study coming from a grant for cancer research.

When Breitbart News reached out to NIH, however, with the same questions, the agency’s media staff responded that one of the grants funding the paper supports “training and career development,” grants which “are crucial to sustaining an infrastructure of qualified researchers in the United States.”

Regarding the other grant the researchers for the paper cited, NIH replied, “[U]ses 2007-2015 national data on Medicare beneficiaries to examine three things: (1) temporal changes in the prevalence, duration, and dose of opioid use in older adults; (2) variation of opioid use across providers and patient and provider factors associated with opioid use in older adults; (3) the risk of adverse outcomes including falls, fractures, emergency room visits, hospitalization, institutionalization, and mortality in older patients receiving opioids.”

“The grant allows for the principal investigators to use the data to examine multiple factors related to opioid prescribing,” NIH said.

NIH media staff did not respond to Breitbart News’s follow-up questions regarding potential improvements to public policy and clinical practice that could be expected from such a study and why NIH thinks the subject is worthy of American taxpayer dollars.

Dr. Jane Orient, executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS), told Breitbart News the “study” is “really a data-mining operation” that “is primarily evidence of how political the AMA and research establishment have become.”

“It has nothing conceivable to do with cancer and suggests that people taking chronic opioids are more likely to be Trump voters,” she said. “However, there is no way to connect how an individual voted with his drug usage.”

“The authors seem to assume that chronic opioid use has some correlation with political views – how about with chronic pain?” Orient asked. “Deaths in someone with an opioid prescription may be attributed to the prescription drug but may actually be due to abuse of alcohol or illicit drugs – so it is likely incorrect to say that prescription drug use accounts for half the overdose deaths–a major fallacy.”

A recent article at Conservative Review, in fact, observed that heroin and fentanyl were causing the U.S. crisis:

[T]he supply and dangerous nature of the drugs coming into this country from Mexico (or from China and then distributed by the Mexican cartels) since 2013-2014 are at an epidemic level, dwarfing anything we’ve seen before. It all began with the suspension of immigration enforcement from 2010-2014 and suspension of interior enforcement.

“Whether you support Trump or not, there’s no debate over this: the diversion of cancer research funds for political purposes is bad for patients,” states IP4PI. “In addition, it is improper to use health crises like the opioid epidemic in this manner. The NIH should demand that the taxpayer dollars spent on this ‘study’ be returned.”",https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/07/trump-opioids-ap.jpg,[],https://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/07/05/taxpayers-fund-study-linking-trump-support-opioid-abuse/,2018-07-05 00:00:00
"FS1’s Broussard: The Most ‘Woke’ Thing a Black Man Can Do Is Get Married, Raise ‘Strong, Intelligent Black Kids’",['Breitbart News'],"Thursday on Fox Sports 1’s “Speak for Yourself,” NBA analyst Chris Broussard reacted to San Antonio Spurs rookie guard Lonnie Walker IV saying in a now-deleted tweet he “will never celebrate 4th of July.”

Instead of disparaging the rookie for his “misguided” tweet, Broussard said Walker could show how “woke” he is by raising a strong family and using his wealth and influence to improve opportunities for black people.

“I like that he showed some knowledge of black history and racial consciousness and level of commitment to black people,” Broussard began. “It’s misguided, and I would say take that and gear it in a positive direction. I would say to him, ‘Look, you want to be revolutionary? You want to be woke? The most revolutionary thing a black man can do in 2018 in America is partner with a wife and raise strong, intelligent black kids who are committed to the upliftment of black people. … Keep the social and moral values that you grew up with in church or the mosque or the temple, because when you get in mainstream America, they try to take those away from you and change you.'”

He added, “Finally, I would say to Lonnie, ‘Use your platform, your wealth, your connections, your influence, whatever you get as an NBA player, to help improve the educational, economic and employment opportunities for African-American people. That’s being woke and would be more than kneeling or not celebrating a certain holiday.”

Rooney says he ‘needed’ MLS move as new challenge looms,['Breitbart News'],"Washington (AFP) – Former England and Manchester United star Wayne Rooney said Monday his move to D.C. United and Major League Soccer was the change he “needed” at the “right time for me.”

The 32-year-old striker was unveiled Monday by D.C. United after leaving Premier League side Everton and agreeing to terms with the struggling US capital team on a 3 1/2-year deal worth a reported $13 million.

“I think it’s what I needed,” Rooney said. “It was the right time for me.”

Rooney is due to make his debut for the club on July 14 against Vancouver when United opens its new 20,000-seat stadium, $200 million Audi Field.

“The game has grown so much over here, new stadiums, big crowds,” Rooney said. “I’m excited by the project.”

United chief executive Jason Levien dubbed Rooney “a living legend who is going to bring so much excitement to our fan base” and added, “To have Wayne lead us on the field into our new era is going to be glorious.”

Rooney cannot sign a contract with United until the transfer window opens on July 10.

The Merseysider vowed he had not moved to MLS for a final lucrative payday.

“I’m not here to see out my last few years,” Rooney said. “I’m here to compete and I’m here to win.”

That could be tough at the start. United is at the bottom of MLS with two wins and 10 points from 13 matches.

“It’s an exciting challenge,” Rooney said. “I’ve watched the league from afar the past few years. We need to improve. That’s clear to see. We need to get better results.

“This team has some young talent and they can improve with some guidance. They can learn some things from me and I can learn some things from them.

“New country, new culture, everything is new to me. I will embrace it. I look forward to the challenge. I’m delighted to be here.”

Rooney will take a break Tuesday to watch his former England squad face Colombia in a World Cup knockout match.

“The team is playing with a lot of freedom and energy. The future is bright whether it’s this year or the next World Cup,” Rooney said. “We’ve got to get behind them and give them our support.”

Rooney said he preferred Washington over New York or Los Angeles because of its slower pace.

“I’ve been to LA and New York. It’s too hectic,” Rooney said. “I need my space to get away from things when I need to and this seemed like a place where I could do that.”

– Rooney feels the heat –

United, which has won four MLS titles but none since 2004, will add more talent alongside Rooney in its bid to recapture the glory days.

“I’m sure there are more players going to come,” Rooney said. “The club is moving in the right direction. The league has gotten better and the club has to get better and they have realized that.

“For the club to move forward, we will need to bring in a few more players. I’m sure the club is looking at that.”

United general manager Dave Kasper said preparing Rooney to be ready in two weeks is the first challenge.

“He’s in his pre-season and he has to get fit in 100-degree heat to boot,” Kasper said.

“It’s hot,” Rooney said. “The one thing I was concerned about was whether I would be able to breathe in the heat but it has been OK so far.”",https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/07/wi/afp/06/b82a42_wayne-rooney-united-speaks-his-introduction-press-conference-newseum.jpg,[],https://www.breitbart.com/news/rooney-says-he-needed-mls-move-as-new-challenge-looms-4/,
Amesbury ‘Major Incident’ is Second Novichok Poisoning in Four Months,['Breitbart News'],"British police have confirmed the couple identified locally as Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley who were taken ill on Saturday were poisoned with the Cold-War era, Soviet-produced Novichok nerve agent.

The pair, both in their mid-40s and reportedly with no political background to suggest they may have been deliberately targeted in an attack, are at the centre of the second apparent Novichock nerve agent incident in the United Kingdom in four months.

Speaking to journalists, Assistant Commissioner of Specialist Operations Neil Basu of the Metropolitan Police said he had received test results from the British chemical weapons research establishment at the Porton Down laboratory which confirmed the two victims, who have not been formally identified, were “exposed to the nerve agent Novichok”.

It is not clear how this might have happened, and no contaminated objects have yet been found. It is not known whether the Novichok, in this case, is from the same incident as March, but police are treating that as a possibility.

UPDATE: Samples have been sent to chemical weapons research establishment Porton Down and counter terror police are investigating after two people collapsed in Amesbury following exposure to an ""unknown substance"" https://t.co/csibfiKUjS — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) July 4, 2018

Police initially believed the pair had taken contaminated drugs, however, the symptoms presented caused deeper concern. Both remain in critical condition, and counter-terror police have joined the investigation.

If the Amesbury incident transpires to be linked to the Salisbury attack — the towns are less than ten miles apart and the latest victims are reported to have visited Salisbury shortly before falling ill — it could be a hard blow for the credibility of the government, which reassured the public in March that the risk from further contamination was low.

Breitbart London reported in March over public anger at the British government’s “diabolical” slow reaction to the chemical attack in Salisbury, after it took a whole week for officials to advise people who had frequented areas that may have been contaminated to wash their clothes, shoes, and handbags. The manager of a local shop said at the time: “The way the public has been kept in the dark is diabolical.

Public Anger at ‘Diabolical’ Response as Authorities Only Admit Risk to Public Days After Salisbury Attack https://t.co/lnR6hDNLEm — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 12, 2018

“They knew on Tuesday that it was serious enough to shut those places down yet they didn’t give a warning about washing your clothes until a week later . . . What are the authorities going to say to the parents of a young child who is contaminated with nerve gas because they were in Zizzi or The Mill last Sunday?”

In the latest case, it took over four days for the authorities to identify the nerve agent responsible for the latest hospitalisations. Public Health England maintains there is not a “significant health risk to the wider public”.

Exclusive – Foreign Minister: No One Could Say ‘Hungary First’ Before Trump’s Rise,['Breitbart News'],"Péter Szijjártó, Hungary’s minister of foreign affairs and trade, explained how the “America First” platform changed European political realities in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News Deputy Political Editor Amanda House.

“We respect the decision of the America people. We respect [President Donald Trump’s] endeavors towards putting America First,” Szijjártó told House, making it clear that, as foreigners, the Hungarian government had no wish to interfere in American domestic affairs.

Szijjártó is a leading official in Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s Fidesz Party government that has caused such consternation among the globalist politicians in Europe. He went on to explain how Trump’s rise to the White House had changed the political situation in Europe. “Saying ‘America First’ was a huge deliberation for patriotic forces in Europe. Because before President Trump had been elected, saying … ‘Hungary First’ was immediately stigmatized as ‘nationalist,’ even ‘fascist.’ Now, those who put critiques on us because of that are a little bit more careful,” he told House.

“Saying ‘Hungary First’, your nation first, is such a refreshing feeling. So we like him saying ‘America First’,” Szijjártó said, addressing those in Europe who criticize Trump for his rhetoric. “Who should say ‘America First’ if not the American president? And what should the American president say? What first if not America? For us, it’s obvious.”

In contrast to those foreign officials who attack Trump’s economic nationalist agenda on trade and migration, Szijjártó explained to House, “We definitely understand his patriotic economic policy, because we run a patriotic economic policy as well. … We like the change in approach, that he does not want to lecture all other countries in the world. … He understood the American methodology must not, by definition, work in countries with totally different history, different approaches, different understandings. And, of course, we understand very well his policy on migration.”

Szijjártó also made reference to the efforts of President Barack Obama’s State Department to influence the domestic politics of Central and Eastern European countries. He spoke approvingly of the reluctance of the Trump administration to do the same. “We are happy that those open attempts to interfere in our domestic issues, which happened during the Democrat administration, are not the case anymore,” he told House.",https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/07/Trump_Orban.jpg,[],http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/07/06/exclusive-foreign-minister-no-one-could-say-hungary-first-before-trumps-rise/,2018-07-06 00:00:00
Ronda Rousey Becomes First Female UFC Hall of Fame Inductee,['Breitbart News'],"Former UFC champion Ronda Rousey was inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame on Thursday, becoming the first female fighter to ever receive such an honor.

Rousey, who also made history by becoming the UFC’s first female champion, defended her title six times from 2012-2015 during her reign as Bantamweight champion.

According to ESPN, “[Rousey] won her first 12 professional mixed martial arts fights, including six in the UFC, all by submission, with 11 of the 12 fights ending in the first round. All but three of those fights were decided in under one minute, and Rousey owns records for four of the five fastest finishes in UFC women’s bantamweight history.”

“I am not the first person who had the ability to do this, but I am here because I am the first person you took the time to watch,” Rousey said during her induction speech. “That you put the energy into supporting. Because of you, I am the first woman standing up here accepting this incredible honor. May I be the first of many.”

Prior to Rousey’s arrival in 2011, UFC President Dana White had said that women would never compete in his company’s events. That all changed two years later when Rousey made her first appearance at UFC 157.

“In my almost 18 years as UFC president, I’ve learned many valuable lessons,” White said during Rousey’s presentation. “And the one that comes to mind tonight is never say never, especially when you’re talking to UFC. In my defense, when I famously said women would never fight in the UFC, I had never met Ronda Rousey. I had never met the woman who would change everything. She started by changing my mind and she ended up changing the world.”

As ESPN reports:

Rousey quickly became one of the sport’s biggest stars. She headlined her last four pay-per-view fights, with the final two drawing 1.1 million pay-per-view buys, and the one before that producing 900,000 buys. The only other UFC fighters to attract those numbers since 2014 are Conor McGregor and Brock Lesnar. She was named the most dominant active athlete by multiple outlets in 2015, and an online ESPN poll during that time tabbed Rousey as the best female athlete ever. She also became a crossover celebrity during that time with supporting roles in the films “The Expendables 3,” “Furious 7” and “Entourage.” Rousey was one of the biggest stars in the world and viewed as unbeatable, until her shocking second-round knockout loss to Holly Holmin front of 56,214 fans in Melbourne, Australia, on Nov. 15, 2015. She returned one year later but was knocked out again, this time just 48 seconds into the first round against Amanda Nunes at UFC 207 in Las Vegas on Dec. 30, 2016. Rousey has not competed in MMA since that loss. She signed with the WWE in January.

Rousey stressed her appreciation for the fans in her acceptance remarks.

“Every time I walked into that cage, I was hoping to make you proud,” Rousey told the audience. “We have had this incredible journey, and it was really an honor to be able to live it with you.”

China counterpunches against US in growing trade war,['Breitbart News'],"Washington (AFP) – China on Friday struck back against US President Donald Trump’s trade offensive, intensifying the expanding and unpredictable dispute between the world’s two largest economies.

Late Friday, China announced it was expanding its existing complaint against the United States at the World Trade Organization, hours after the countries slapped tit-for-tat tariffs on billions of dollars of cross-border trade.

Beijing called the new stage of the confrontation — which began when Washington pulled the trigger on 25 percent duties on $34 billion annual imports of Chinese machinery, electronics and other goods — “the largest trade war in economic history.”

China’s foreign ministry said retaliatory tariffs of equal size and scope had taken effect “immediately.”

There was confusion about exactly what US products would be hit in the initial wave of tariffs as China’s Commerce Ministry had not published an updated list.

Economists have warned escalating trade frictions could throttle global growth and strike at the heart of the world trading system, causing shockwaves across the planet and potentially disrupting years of economic growth.

US trade data released Friday showed exporters hit a record, as importers bumped up purchases, particularly of tariff-targeted US soy beans, to build up supplies before the new duties hit.

Analysts said this was the quiet before the storm, with US exports likely to fall off in the third quarter as both sides feel the effects of worsening trade relations.

The new tariffs could just be the opening skirmish in the trade war, as US President Donald Trump has vowed to hit as much as $450 billion in Chinese goods, the vast majority of that country’s imports.

That would add to disputes underway with Canada, Mexico and the European Union, which could worsen if he goes ahead with threatened tariffs on autos.

China’s government also announced it was adding this round of tariffs to an existing complaint filed with the WTO in April shortly after Washington unveiled the threat to punish Beijing for its policies on intellectual property.

– Weaker GDP in China –

Months of dialogue between the two economic superpowers, including in the WTO, appeared to have failed, with Trump warning just hours before the tariffs came into effect that Washington was ready to escalate the dispute with duties on hundreds of billions of dollars more in Chinese imports.

Trump repeatedly has slammed what he describes as Beijing’s underhanded economic treatment of the United States. The US trade deficit in goods with China ballooned to a record $375.2 billion last year, stoking his ire.

US officials accuse China of building its industrial dominance by stealing the “crown jewels” of American technological know-how through cyber-theft, forced transfers of intellectual property and state-sponsored corporate acquisitions.

Despite dire warnings about the impact on the US, Trump believes the robust American economy can outlast its rivals in the current battle.

But China also believes its economy, with a greater focus on domestic demand and a reduced dependence on exports, can ride out the storm.

A member of China’s central bank monetary policy committee, Ma Jun, said the first punches will have a “limited impact” on the nation’s economy and would only trim GDP growth by 0.2 percentage points.

With only $130 billion in US imports to retaliate against, Beijing has said it will take “qualitative” and “quantitative” measures against the US, triggering fears it could cripple the operations of US multinationals operating there.

Beijing has accused the US of “firing on the whole world” with the measures, pointing out that most of the Chinese exports under attack are largely made by companies with foreign investment — including from America.

China’s Premier Li Keqiang said on a visit to Sofia that “A trade war benefits no-one because it hurts free trade and the multilateral process.”

– Russia joins the fray –

Global markets initially wobbled at the news but soon forged higher with Wall Street boosted by bullish employment numbers while Asian and European stocks also cast aside their worries, at least temporarily.

With stock markets uneasy, Li Daxiao, analyst at Yingda Securities, said news of the tariffs was already priced into the market, “therefore investors are not in as much of a panic as before.”

On the streets of Beijing, there were some concerns that prices would rise due to the tariffs but also a determination to support the Beijing authorities in the trade war.

“I will try my best to support domestic products. I think products made in China are the best,” said one shopper in a Beijing grocery story, who gave his name as Yang.

Moscow also announced Friday it had slapped 25 percent tariffs on some US goods, joining the global push-back against Trump’s offensive.

And signs are growing that the escalating global trade dispute is already affecting the world’s top economy, driving up prices and disrupting supply chains.

As the tariffs approached, the US central bank warned the impending trade battle was beginning to darken the otherwise blue skies of the robust American economy, now entering its 10th year of recovery.

How to succeed at intermittent fasting,['Lisa Drayer'],"(CNN) ""Intermittent fasting,"" a dieting approach that involves cycling between periods of eating and abstaining from food, has been trending in diet circles. This is in part because reports claim that celebrities such as Beyonce, Hugh Jackman, Ben Affleck and Nicole Kidman are doing it but also because increasingly more research reveals that the eating pattern may promote weight loss and improve overall health.

The method is not appropriate for everyone, however, particularly pregnant women and those with medical conditions such as diabetes or eating disorders. And though studies are promising, it remains to be seen if this type of eating can become a sustainable lifestyle habit instead of a drop-a-dress-size-in-a-week fad.

""The jury is still out, especially on how healthy, sustainable and realistic this approach is,"" said Samantha Heller, a registered dietitian and senior clinical nutritionist at NYU Langone Health in New York. ""Eating very low calories, or none, on alternate days feels punitive to many and may exacerbate an already difficult and complex relationship someone has with food.""

If you are still hoping to give intermittent fasting a try, there are some things to consider that can increase your chances of reaching your goals. Also, be sure to check with your doctor before starting a fasting regimen.

Pick the level of fasting you can handle

The appeal of intermittent fasting may be related to its simplicity, as it seems to require less effort than restricting calories every day. But there are different approaches to the eating pattern that vary in intensity.

One regimen known as time-restricted feeding advises consuming all of your calories within a range of three to 12 hours a day, whereas an approach known as the ""5:2"" diet advises eating 500 to 600 calories for two days of the week and eating whatever you want on the other five days. A third, much more stringent type of regimen involves alternating 24-hour fasting periods (in which no foods or calorie-containing beverages are consumed) with non-fasting days, during which anything can be eaten in any amount.

Though time-restricted feeding might not seem that different from a typical eating day, especially if you tend to skip breakfast, alternate-day fasting may cause intense hunger on fasting days and can be much more challenging to sustain.

""People who are accustomed to eating regularly scheduled meals or suffer from 'head hunger' may find alternate-day fasting extremely difficult,"" said Kristen Smith, a registered dietitian and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Head hunger is the desire to eat when you are not physically hungry but are triggered to eat by emotions and social factors.

For the greatest success, Smith recommends choosing a fasting regimen that best suits your lifestyle, your health history and your ability to sustain fasting. For example, alternate-day fasting may not be appropriate for someone with an active job that requires manual labor or a job that centers around food, such as a chef.

Focus on protein and fiber-rich foods on semi-fasting days

Protein and fiber-rich foods will keep you feeling full and satisfied, which is important when calories are strictly limited. Healthy fats such as nuts and peanut butter can also curb hunger but provide a lot of calories for a small portion size.

If you are limiting your calories to about 500 to 600 per day, you might focus on one or two mini meals and snacks. Smith recommends a small piece of grilled salmon with half a cup of steamed veggies, grilled chicken over spaghetti squash, an egg-white omelet with veggies or black beans with a cup of veggies. For snacks, she favors fat-free plain Greek yogurt, two cups of plain popcorn, a cup of raw veggie sticks or a medium piece of fruit.

High-volume foods such as soups may also help on semi-fasting days, as they can fill you up on fewer calories than solid foods. Additionally, meal replacement bars may provide a convenient option, especially if you don't feel like preparing food on fasting days.

Don't gorge on non-fasting days

Our bodies want to keep us alive. If we are consuming very few calories on certain days, when we do eat, our bodies are going to do everything they can to encourage us to eat a lot because they don't know when the next meal will be available, Heller explained. ""We also feel that as a reward for sticking to 500 calories or less, we are allowed and 'deserve' to eat large portions of whatever we want,"" she said.

That kind of reward can bring unintended consequences. ""Overdoing it on a non-fasting day and eating excessive calories may actually lead to consuming an amount of calories you would consume in two days and defeat the purpose of a fasting day,"" Smith said.

In other words, having pancakes with bacon for breakfast, a fried chicken sandwich for lunch and a cheeseburger with fries for dinner on a non-fasting day can stall weight loss and prevent you from reaching your goals.

Don't go overboard with exercise on fasting days

Strenuous exercise, such as cycling, running, high-impact aerobics and weight lifting, is not advised on fasting days because the body does not have the fuel available to sustain rigorous activity, Heller explained.

If you want to do some form of physical activity on those days, Smith recommends sticking with walking, stretching or gentle yoga.

Drink enough water

If you decide to avoid food for any length of time, adequate hydration is important and should be maintained. ""On a fasting day, someone may be more likely to become dehydrated because they aren't eating regularly scheduled meals, which is a common time people hydrate,"" Smith said.

Foods such as fruits, vegetables and broth-based soups contain significant amounts of water and can help you stay hydrated. Those fasting should be cautious with caffeine-containing beverages, as they may contribute to dehydration, Smith said.

Know when to stop

If you experience lightheadedness, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, headaches,difficulty concentrating or any other symptoms that regularly interfere with your daily functioning, you should stop fasting.

Former Sunday school teacher charged with sexually assaulting children for years,['Kristy Steward'],"A former North Carolina Sunday school teacher is being held on a $1 million bond after charges he molested multiple children in the Johnston County church where he served as a Sunday school teacher.

Jonathan Young, 34, of Benson, faces 13 charges including six charges of first-degree rape of a child, three charges of statutory rape, two charges of first-degree sexual offense and two charges of indecent liberties with a child.

Young was a Sunday school teacher at the Firstborn Baptist Church where at least some of the incidents happened.

Officials say, some of the cases date back as far as 15 years ago. The youngest victim was just 7 years old at the time.

These trans actors could have been cast instead of Scarlett Johansson in her new movie,['Nicole Chavez'],"(CNN) Scarlett Johansson is once again at the center of a Hollywood casting controversy.

In 2016 there was backlash after the actress was cast as a Japanese character in the film ""Ghost in the Shell,"" based on a popular Japanese manga series.

This time there is criticism surrounding her role as a transgender man.

Johansson is set to star in ""Rub & Tug"" as Dante ""Tex"" Gill , a trans man known for running a string of massage parlors in Pittsburgh that were fronts for prostitution in the 1970s and 1980s.

The film is set to be directed by Rupert Sanders, who also made ""Ghost on the Shell.""

Some took to Twitter to offer their thoughts on Johansson's casting.

What's next? Is Scarlett Johansson going to play Barack Obama? — Eugene Gu, MD (@eugenegu) July 4, 2018

One man sarcastically asked if Johansson's next role would be to play the first black president of the United States.

Scarlett Johansson is playing a trans man in her next movie because her ultimate career goal is to take an acting job from a member of each and every marginalized group. — Faith Choyce (@faithchoyce) July 3, 2018

Another woman accused Johansson of wanting to take acting jobs away from every marginalized group.

CNN has reached out to Johansson for comment.

Minority actors have long complained that they struggle to get cast in Hollywood even as producers say they can't find the right actors for their projects.

Here are a few actors who could have been considered for the ""Rub & Tug"" film:

Ellie Desautels

Desautels is among the few actors who are nonbinary -- people who identify themselves as neither male nor female -- and who have appeared on prime-time network series. Most recently, Desautels played a transgender high school student named Michael Hallowell in the now-canceled NBC drama ""Rise.""

""We need roles written for everyone -- and casting directors should then know how to cast those roles accordingly,"" the actor said in an interview with GLAAD

Chaz Bono

The LGBT advocate and child of performer Cher and the late entertainer and politician Sonny Bono was the first transgender contestant on ""Dancing With the Stars.""

Last year, the 49-year-old actor starred on ""American Horror Story: Cult.""

Bono also is the author of several books, including ""Transition,"" in which he talks about identifying as a transgender man.

Emmett Jack Lundberg

Lunderg is a filmmaker and actor known for ""Brothers,"" a web series following the lives of four transgender male friends in Brooklyn.

Ian Harvie

A former standup comedian, Harvie has starred in several TV series.

The trans actor appeared in Amazon's ""Transparent"" in 2014 and since then has been a guest star on several other shows, including NBC's ""Will & Grace.""

""When we get to see ourselves in the media, we get to feel like we exist, especially when there's positive representations of trans people,"" Harvie said in an interview with CNN's Brooke Baldwin.

'Give transgender talent a chance'

Transgender roles in movies and TV are rare. Until recently non-transgender actors were mostly cast in those parts.

Only 17 regular and recurring transgender characters were tracked across broadcast, cable and streaming television series in the 2017-2018 season, according to a report released by GLAAD Media Institute.

On Tuesday, Johansson responded to those critical of her casting in the forthcoming film by mentioning others who have played trans roles in Hollywood.

""Tell them that they can be directed to Jeffrey Tambor, Jared Leto and Felicity Huffman's reps for comment,"" she said in a statement obtained by Bustle

Jared Leto won an Oscar in 2014 for his portrayal of a transgender woman with AIDS in ""Dallas Buyers Club."" Felicity Huffman earned an Oscar nomination for her role as a trans woman in the 2005 film ""Transamerica.""

""I'm not going to say this beautifully: To you people out there ... please give transgender talent a chance. Give them auditions. Give them their story,"" Tambor said in his acceptance speech in 2016.

Ariana Grande didn't find Pete Davidson's Manchester joke funny,['Lisa Respers France'],"(CNN) Ariana Grande says she doesn't like something her fiancé did, but she still supports him.

Before Pete Davidson and Grande became a couple, the comic and ""Saturday Night Live"" star reportedly made a joke about the bombing at Grande's Manchester, United Kingdom concert.

Hundreds were injured and 22 people were killed in May 2017 after a suicide bombing at Grande's concert.

A little over a year later, Grande told British Vogue she was still suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome because of the tragedy.

""It's hard to talk about because so many people have suffered such severe, tremendous loss,"" Grande said.

Last month the singer and Davidson made headlines after he confirmed they had gotten engaged after weeks of dating.

But some fans have been questioning why Grande has continued the relationship, given Davidson's past joke.

One fan tweeted, ""I respect Ariana and I want her to be happy and everything, but she was just broken after the Manchester bombing, so I don't know why she is still with Pete, like yeah he made that joke a while ago, but like it's not funny, it's just rude. This is my opinion.""

Grande responded to that tweet on Thursday.

"Venice Biennale 2018 highlights: US, British and Turkish pavilions","['Venice', 'Ann Liu', 'Teddy Cruz']","Allyssia Alleyne , CNN Venice, Italy Written by

Architect Teddy Cruz is frank: ""In this day and age, we are not proud of what is going on in the United States,"" he said, referring to himself and his long-term collaborator, Fonna Forman.

The sentiment is not unexpected from the Guatemalan-born American architect who, with Forman, a political scientist, has long explored citizenship and urban dynamics at the United States-Mexico border, and the ecological, humanitarian and economic threat it poses in its militarized state. But it's not something you expect to hear at the US Pavilion at the Venice Architecture Biennale, funded in part by the State Department.

The most important event on the international architecture calendar, the Biennale is where nations have sent their greatest thinkers to hash out the most pressing themes and issues gripping their industry -- and society at large. So, it was perhaps inevitable that the shadow of the Trump administration would loom dark over the American exhibition. Titled ""Dimensions of Citizenship,"" it sees Cruz and Forman, among many others, interrogating what it means to occupy different spaces -- a body, a region, a nation, a planet.

This year's Biennale theme, ""Freespace,"" feels particularly poignant at a time when many Americans feel as though their freedoms -- or the stories they tell themselves about what it means to live in the Land of the Free -- are under threat.

""They're not just antagonistic. They bring in a rich and nuanced discussion that is often lacking from the national conversation."" Ann Liu, curator

The contrast between the research and artwork displayed on the walls of the Palladian-style US Pavilion and the rhetoric from the White House is overt. In the courtyard, a rope-and-steel braided installation, a tribute to the value of black lives from artists Amanda Williams, Andres L. Hernandez and Shani Crowe, jars with President Donald Trump's defense of white nationalists as ""some very fine people.""

""I think for all of us in the discipline, we as citizens had concerns and feelings about the kind of troubling administration and the questions about belonging that emerge in the wake of the inauguration, and so we're really grateful for these kind of practices to both situate those questions in a longer history, and also start to move us forward and give us framework for talking and working on these things moving into the future,"" said Ann Lui, an assistant professor at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and one of the curators of ""Dimensions of Citizenship.""

""They're not just antagonistic. They bring in a rich and nuanced discussion that is often lacking from the national conversation.""

None of the presentations seem as paradoxical as ""MEXUS: A Geography of Interdependence,"" Estudio Teddy Cruz + Fonna Forman's deep dive into the ecological regions along the US-Mexico border, given Trump's border wall promises and anti-Mexican statements . In a simple display, primarily using information boards and a projected topographical map, they show how the border has bifurcated eight watersheds, and outline the negative effects of US infrastructure built along this demarcation -- particularly how it has affected areas like water management in both countries, and American ecological conservancy efforts.

""What we've tried to do in 'MEXUS,' in this intervention, is to reimagine the border zone not as a line, not as a jurisdictional boundary, but as a region that shares many ecologies and lots of movement back and forth on both sides -- people, environmental flows, economic flows, emotional and ethnic flows and so forth; to reimagine these regions as places of potential collaboration and interdependence,"" said Forman.

""We've tried to take the idea of citizenship back, untether it from the idea of the nation-state and expand it into a more ethical concept and practical concept of interdependence.""

To Cruz and Forman, this focus on the ecological element is part of a broader goal to reframe how the public perceives the border and, consequently, the people living on the other side of it. Inspired by the work of former Bogota, Colombia mayor Antanas Mockus, a friend who championed a model of civic engagement tied to culture and education, they hope their work will ""change hearts and minds"" and, eventually, influence public policy.

""Architects more and more need to take a political position against what is morally and ethically wrong."" Teddy Cruz, architect

""We work a lot at times oscillating between architecture and art and we realize that many artists at this moment want to engage very ephemeral interventions into the territory or into the city just as acts of protest, but at times we have felt uncomfortable with the ephemeral nature of these works that, at times, do not amount to very much, even though it is essential to have such instances of protest,"" Cruz said.

""The border has been sold to the American public as an artifact of security when, in fact, we can prove that it's an artifact of insecurity, environmentally and socioeconomically. So, this whole idea of how to transform the mythologies that have perpetuated fear and division needs new tools of engagement and forms of cross-border education.""

So far, their efforts seem to have had some success. According to letters displayed at the Biennale, government agencies and academics across the border of Tijuana and San Diego, where Cruz and Forman teach at the University of California, have voiced support for the development of a cross-border conservation plan to protect the Tijuana River Valley.

A different type of reframing is taking place at the British Pavilion, where Caruso St John Architects and artist Marcus Taylor are countering the Brexit-era rhetoric of isolationism and nationalism with a striking gesture. Instead of setting up an exhibition, the curators left the pavilion, idyllically located on a hill overlooking the Giardini, empty, and have instead erected ""Island,"" a sparse, scaffolding-supported rooftop platform to be used as a communal space for visitors and delegates from all countries.

""We're offering this space to Venice and to this Biennale at a time when Britain is so completely ambivalent in terms of signals,"" said Adam Caruso, a co-founder of Caruso St John Architects, who immigrated to London from Montreal 34 years ago.

""In and amongst all of this ambiguity and conflicted signals, we're trying to do something that is genuinely open and generous because, I think, Britain, until recently, has been to do with tolerance and has been a place where immigrants have escaped to and their contribution has been recognized.""

This idea of inclusion is further explored in the accompanying book , also titled ""Island,"" that includes short stories from Trinidad-born author Sam Sevlon, one of the first novelists to give a voice to the increasingly beleaguered Windrush generation , previously unreleased photos from Ghanaian-British artist John Akomfrah, and a full script of Shakespeare's ""The Tempest.""

Architect and curator Kerem Piker has staged a similarly international project at Turkey's pavilion in the Biennale's Arsenale venue. Over the next six months, 122 architecture students from 16 countries will meet in small groups to build connections and develop installations that riff on various architectural themes.

""The idea of the Biennale is to unite. So instead of limiting it only within the nation, we wanted to keep it open. We wanted to be a part of the culture,"" Piker explained. ""That's why we don't need boundaries.""

Separated migrant parents sue US immigration officials for more communication with children,"['David Shortell', 'Veronica Stracqualursi']","Washington (CNN) Three Central American parents are suing US immigration officials for more communication with their children who were separated from them after they crossed the US-Mexico border illegally.

In a court filing Thursday, lawyers for the three parents alleged that immigration authorities are not ensuring ample communication between the parents and their young children.

The children mentioned in the lawsuit are among the less than 3,000 children estimated to have been separated from their parents. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar released the new estimate on Thursday during a call with reporters nearly two weeks after HHS provided an exact figure of 2,053 children in their care.

The Texas Rio Grande Legal Aid lawyers detailed some of the ""various hurdles in arranging communications"" for the parents and their children in the joint status report, filed as part of an ongoing lawsuit brought in DC federal court against top Department of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services officials.

One plaintiff, a Honduran citizen, only spoke to his 12-year-old daughter on Tuesday -- a month after the pair was separated, the legal aid lawyers claim.

'A man of sublime taste': Pierre Bergé's treasured belongings up for auction,['Natalia Rachlin'],"Written by Natalia Rachlin, CNN

A much-admired businessman, intellectual, avid collector and undeniable aesthete, the late Pierre Bergé was also widely known as the co-founder of the Yves Saint Laurent fashion house, and the designer's one-time romantic partner and lifelong friend.

A household name across his native France, Bergé, who died in September 2017, will now posthumously reveal the dynamic contents of his very own households, when his estate comes to auction this autumn as part of a three-day sale at Sotheby's Paris, from October 29-31.

Organized in partnership with Pierre Bergé & Associés, a Paris-based auction house which specializes in fine art and antiques co-founded by Bergé in 2002, the sale will put some 1,200 items grouped into approximately 800 lots, on the block. Sourced from Bergé's four properties in Normandy, Provence, Paris and Tangiers, Morocco -- the houses have all gone to market, too -- the contents will reveal his wide-ranging passions and interests, from furniture and fine art that span many genres, decades and origins, to tabletop service, lighting, desktop objects and charming miscellanea.

The sale will include plenty of art, ornamentation and table service used in the dining room of Bergé's Rue Bonaparte residence in Paris. Credit: Sotheby's

Up to $9 million

""I have never seen such diversity in a private collection,"" said Mario Tavella, Chairman of Sotheby's France and Sotheby's Europe, during a phone interview. ""There is no domain, no category that he was not interested in. Through the houses I have discovered, without any surprise, a highly sophisticated man, a voracious man in terms of interests, a man of sublime taste. There is no object that is overlooked: one that is estimated at 100 Euros is as tasteful as one estimated at 300,000.""

Among the cheapest items will be a series of wicker furniture from Bergé's Provence residence. Among the priciest, a series of ten paintings by the French expressionist Bernard Buffet, completed early in his career when he was romantically involved with Bergé; a mirror by husband-and-wife artists François-Xavier and Claude Lalanne (Les Lalanne), commissioned by Bergé and Saint Laurent for their onetime home on Rue Bonaparte in Paris; and a series of Orientalist paintings, which featured in Bergé's Paris bedroom, a space decadently paneled with antique 18th century Indian textiles.

Though estimates are still being finalized and the catalog completed -- the contents of the Normandy ""Dacha"" are yet to be reviewed -- Tavella notes that prices are likely to range from a few-hundred to a half-million Euros. He expects the overall sale to total between €5 to €8 million (about $5.8 to $9.3 million) with all proceeds going to the two causes that were most dear to Bergé: the Pierre Bergé -- Yves Saint Laurent Foundation in Paris, and the Fondation Majorelle in Marrakech, which sustains the lush Majorelle Gardens that Bergé and YSL purchased in 1980, saving the historic oasis from development.

Broad audience

With an almost mythical allure attributed to the aesthetic life that Bergé and Saint Laurent shared, Tavella expects that the sale will attract a broad audience: both serious collectors and more novice buyers, perhaps looking to acquire a piece of cultural history.

""Bergé's collection represents a way of life: for example, all the spectacular silver service and glassware that was used when we had dinner with him, it captures a bit of a world and a way of living that is going to disappear,"" said Antoine Godeau, President of Pierre Bergé Associés, and a longtime friend of Bergé's, during a phone interview. ""But Pierre was never nostalgic: he didn't believe that objects belonged to the owner, it was a temporary situation, before they went back to the market. As they will do now.""

Godeau notes that Bergé was a keen and fascinated spectator at the record-breaking auction of Saint Laurent's estate at Christie's in 2009, which at the time broke records for the sale of a private collection (since overtaken by the sale of the Rockefeller collection in May this year), raising over €373 million, or about $432 million, for charity.

While the Bergé sale will be much more modest in scope, the auction arguably marks the final chance to connect with one of the most dynamic collectors of our time, and one half of the most revered creative power-couple of the last century. Though, a fourth and final day of sales, devoted entirely to Bergé's legendary collection of books and manuscripts, will follow in Paris this December. For the October sale, Tavella says that while Sotheby's initially considered only auctioning the more valuable items in Bergé's collection, they ultimately decided to include everything -- down to a set of metal garden chairs -- to capture the full-spectrum of the lifestyle that Bergé embodied.

From Rococo to Art Nouveau and Surrealism, Bergé's interested spanned many creative movements as seen in almost every nook of his Paris home, which boasted an eclectic array of objects and art. Credit: Sotheby's Art Digital Studio

""Sometimes you enter houses where everything is very valuable, and so much of the time I see houses which are meant to impress others,"" says Tavella. ""In effect, I discovered that Bergé found joy also in much simpler interiors and more decorative objects, which is very dynamic. In Bergé's case, what I really loved was that his houses were clearly made to please himself, and for him to live well. It was not at all a show off, but a celebration of beauty.""",http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180618170521-pierre-berge-la-datcha-super-tease.jpg,[],http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/pierre-berge-yves-saint-laurent-sothebys-auction/index.html,2018-06-19 09:21:16+00:00
Zoodles really are the magic alternative to starchy pastas,[],"Story highlights The smart way to imitate pasta? ""Zoodles"" or zucchini noodles. Keep scrolling to shop the kitchen tool you need.

Have you heard of zoodles —zucchini ""noodles""? If you have an Instagram, follow health and wellness blogs, or adhere to a paleo-style diet, chances are you have.

Zucchini noodles are exactly what they sound like: a zucchini is cut into thin, noodle-like curls using an appliance called a spiralizer. Once they're cooked in boiling water or sautéed on the stove, these nutritious (and low-carb) zoodles serve as a pasta replacement.

In recent years, the zucchini noodle craze has taken off, and kitchen appliance brands far and wide have produced a range of spiralizers so you can concoct this healthy pasta alternative at home. Our favorite product for making zoodles also happens to be an Amazon best-selling product: The Spiralizer 5-Blade Vegetable Slicer ($27.99, originally $49.99; amazon.com). And, with close to 10,000 Amazon reviews giving this product a 4.6- out of 5-star rating, we're pretty certain you'll love how it functions, too.

This Spiralizer five-blade model makes the zoodle-making process easy. With a stronger blade than ever before, this new and improved 2017 model was designed to cut through all veggies — even tough root vegetables — so that you can switch up the types of produce used to create pasta alternatives at home. Should you run out of recipe ideas, purchasing this product also guarantees you access to three exclusive e-books full of zoodle recipes so that you can regularly change up your veggie-based meals.

For those who like to cook, zucchini noodles serve as a great base food for dreaming up fun, healthy recipes. To get you started, we'd suggest checking out this recipe for zucchini noodles with turkey meatballs. A simple Google search will provide a whole host of zoodle recipe ideas so that you (and your family) never get bored in the kitchen.

Not sure you're ready to invest in the real deal five-blade appliance? You can also test out zoodles using this smaller version of a spiralizer ($14.95; amazon.com). While more compact and affordable, this spiralizer requires you to crank out zoodles at a slower pace by hand — rather than using the convenient turn handle on the bigger appliance. But if you want to give the zoodle trend a test run before committing, this product certainly gets the job done and saves you precious cabinet space in the process.

"Adidas' vision for the future: Personalization, fast",['Allen Kim'],"For all but the most elite athletes, buying athletic shoes can be hit or miss: Go to the store, find something you like, and try it on. If it doesn't feel quite right, too bad. Try another shoe.

Adidas sees a future where motion capture tech, data analysis software, and 3D printing come together in the store to create a pair of kicks tailored to your exact needs. One foot slightly smaller than the other? No problem. You overpronate? Don't worry about it. Technology will provide the perfect shoe.

All of the big shoe companies are racing toward that goal. Adidas offered a glimpse of how that might happen when it brought its pop-up Speedfactory Lab Experience to Brooklyn, New York.

The pop-up replicated some of the work Adidas (ADDDF) does at its automated Speedfactory laboratories in Atlanta and Ansbach, Germany. The R&D centers are a proving ground for tricks and technologies Adidas can use to quickly and efficiently produce customized shoes that fit perfectly.

My visit to the Speedfactory Lab Experience started with designers scanning my feet to determine their exact length, width, and positioning. Cameras recorded my stride, speed, and gait as I ran on a treadmill.

All of this data appeared on two screens in front me. I discovered that my left foot is slightly longer and wider than my right, and I am what physiologists call a ""neutral runner."" That means my feet roll slightly inward after making contact with the ground, evenly distributing my weight while helping absorb the impact.

Knowing such things is essential to selecting the right running shoe. But Adidas wants to take things one step further and use that info to create your perfect shoe in almost not time at all.

Adidas can't do that yet, but it's getting there. Zachary Coonrod, senior designer on the futures team at Adidas, said its Speedfactory labs are getting speedier. ""We're three times faster in terms of bringing product from idea to market,"" he said.

Good, but not good enough, said Sucharita Kodali, a retail analyst at Forrester Research.

""The vision of on-demand fast shoes is a great one, but what [Adidas] can actually do is only create a few items on demand quickly,"" she said. ""That's not impressive. If they could create any custom item quickly, that would be a game changer, but that's not what they do -- yet.""

Related: Adidas is still crushing Nike and Under Armour in America

The Speedfactory uses 3D printing, automated manufacturing, and other technology to produce limited edition shoes. So far that's meant developing sneakers tailored to the needs of runners in specific locales. The project started in 2016 with a shoe just for Germany. The company has designed kicks for runners in London, Paris, and New York with its AM4 (Adidas Made For) line. Shoes for runners in Tokyo and Shanghai are in the works.

You might wonder why runners in different cities need different shoes. Well, Adidas discovered that runners in the Big Apple tend to make sharp turns at higher speeds than folks in London. Subtle tweaks to the upper --the top portion of the shoe -- on the AM4NYC help improve stability and agility in such circumstances.

To further customize shoes, Adidas is working with Silicon Valley startup Carbon to tailor midsoles -- arguably the most important part of the shoe. Carbon uses a 3D manufacturing process called Digital Light Synthesis to produce stiff elastomer midsoles that could outperform some of the best foams and gels. Ultimately, adidas plans to incorporate Carbon's manufacturing process into the Speedfactory to expand production and offer more personalized products.

Related: Clash of the Titans: Adidas and Nike continue to battle it out

Adidas released its first product with a Carbon insole back in 2015, the Futurecraft 4D. A limited run of the shoes -- at $300 a pair -- sold out instantly. The company plans to release more than 100,000 pairs by the end of this year. That's a lot of shoes, but nothing compared to the 400 million pairs of shoes it cranked out last year.

Given that kind of scale, you can see why Adidas wants the ability to produce custom shoes in a hurry. It isn't alone in chasing this goal. Brooks Running has teamed up with HP to create FitStation, which uses 3D printing to make insoles and polyurethane injection-molded midsoles for customized shoes. Nike (NKE) started testing its own 3D-printed material, Flyprint, in April. The material allows Nike to tailor a shoe's upper to a runner's foot shape, gait and needs.

None of this comes cheaply, though. The Nike Zoom Vaporfly Elite Flyprint sold for $600, and Nike has so far released only a small number of them. The company has not said whether it will make the shoe more widely available in the future. That's an essential question, because cost and availability remain the biggest hurdle between you and a pair of bespoke shoes.

""Brands can make custom products now, but the shoes themselves are far too expensive to be commercial,"" said Matt Powell, a senior industry analyst for NPD. ""It does not matter who is first [to make them] -- what matters is who is first commercially.""

So far, only the world's best athletes enjoy this level of customization. But if Adidas and its competitors can get the technology to work, you may one day walk out of a store with a pair of shoes that fit like a glove.",https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180626110152-adidas-speedfactory-am4nyc-780x439.jpg,[],http://money.cnn.com/2018/07/06/technology/adidas-speedfactory/index.html,2018-07-06 00:00:00

Rest of whiskey storage warehouse collapses in Kentucky,[],"Whiskey barrels were piled in a mountainous heap Wednesday after the rest of a whiskey storage warehouse collapsed in Kentucky, nearly two weeks after part of the decades-old structure came crashing down.

The remainder of the massive structure collapsed at the Barton 1792 Distillery in Bardstown, Nelson County Emergency Management spokesman Milt Spalding said. No injuries were reported in either collapse, he said.

“It is a mountain of bourbon barrels,” he said Wednesday.

Environmental and wildlife officials were on the scene to determine if any whiskey spilled into a nearby waterway, he said. The distillery owner Sazerac, a Louisiana-based spirits company, already was facing a state fine stemming from the initial collapse.

In a statement, the company said its employees “worked quickly to contain the spill” Wednesday, with none of the new runoff entering any waterways.

After the initial collapse last month, the company said the damaged warehouse had held about 18,000 barrels of aging spirits. Up to half the barrels inside were affected by the first collapse, it said.

The company said at the time that the collapse had affected “a mix of various distilled products at various ages.” On Wednesday, it said it did not know how many barrels can be salvaged or what caused the initial collapse.

Cleanup crews have been at the scene for days, and the company called in “more resources” after the second collapse, Spalding said Wednesday. The warehouse was built in the 1940s.

Following the first collapse, a Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet spokesman said Sazerac would be cited for failing to report the spill of whiskey in a timely manner and for polluting waters. The spokesman said Barton 1792 moved quickly to stop the alcohol from entering the creek but didn’t alert the state quickly enough.

Whiskey flowing into a nearby stream and river killed about 800 fish after the initial collapse, officials said. Bardstown is about 40 miles south of Louisville.

Nelson County Emergency Management director Joe Prewitt said last month he couldn’t recall another whiskey warehouse collapse.

Bourbon ages for years in charred new oak barrels, where it acquires its color and flavor.

Sazerac also owns Buffalo Trace Distillery in Frankfort, Kentucky.

Kentucky’s bourbon sector is in the midst of a more than $1.1 billion boom that includes expanded production facilities, more storage warehouses and new tourism centers.

5 Things You Didn't Know About Ainsley Earhardt,['Ainsley Earhardt'],"5 Things You Didn't Know About Abby Huntsman

Ainsley Earhardt Donates $50K of Book Proceeds to Folds of Honor

Fox News Insider caught up with ""Fox & Friends"" anchor and best-selling author Ainsley Earhardt for an inside look at her life away from the studio.

See what the South Carolina native had to say below...

1. Jesus and my daughter, Hayden, are the best gifts God has ever given me. My faith is something I rely on heavily.

God blessed me with His son and then He blessed me with my very own daughter to love. It's been a wonderful life.

When I go home, I love to open the door and hear my daughter say 'Mama, Mama!' and she runs into my arms and my heart melts.

She is definitely my greatest joy. I pray daily that God blesses me with a very long life so I can watch her grow up and be there for her.

I pray that she comes to know Christ at an early age and that God watches over her as she grows up in this crazy city called New York.

2. I completed a half marathon in Austin, Texas. At first I told my friend there was no way I could run that far. It was actually more of a fast walk, like a shuffle.

We trained and trained and I got better and better and we did it. My leg was killing me, but I made it!

3. I wore three sets of braces because my teeth were so bad. My teeth were really separated when I was young.

One set actually ended up breaking, but it all worked out and now I love my smile!

4. My friend and co-worker Geraldo Rivera was one of my daughter's first babysitters, when I brought her into Fox News Channel for her first TV appearance after she was born.

He watched Hayden in the hallway outside the studio while I was inside. I remember thinking that it was so cool that Geraldo, who I used to watch on TV, was babysitting my daughter for me.

5. When I was a little girl I went with my family to Washington, D.C. for a basketball tournament. My dad was the coach.

We toured the city and saw the space museum and all the monuments, including the White House.

Here I am all these years later, anchoring the #1 morning show on cable news, getting an opportunity to speak to the President of the United States and visiting the Oval Office!

In her new book, The Light Within Me: An Inspirational Memoir, Ainsley offers a powerful, uplifting look at her life and her spiritual journey, reflecting on her family, her faith, and her successful career.

Amy Coney Barrett criticized for ties to People of Praise: A look at the group,['Kaitlyn Schallhorn'],"If President Trump nominates Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, the federal judge can expect her second bruising round of confirmation hearings in less than a year and more of what supporters call ""unfair criticisms"" about her faith.

Barrett, 46, is one of six judges Trump has already interviewed to replace retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy on the bench. She is a federal appeals court judge who was appointed by Trump in 2017. Her Senate confirmation was anything but easy as she was grilled by Democrats about her religious background.

She once told a 2006 Notre Dame Law School graduating class that their “legal career is but a means to an end, and … that end is building the kingdom of God. … If you can keep in mind that your fundamental purpose in life is not to be a lawyer, but to know, love and serve God, you truly will be a different kind of lawyer.”

“The dogma lives loudly within you, and that’s of concern,” Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said during the September 2017 hearing.

When Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill. asked if she was an “orthodox Catholic” -- a term used in a paper she co-authored two decades before -- Barrett clarified she is a “faithful Catholic” but would “stress my personal church affiliation or my religious belief would not bear on the discharge of my duties as a judge.”

After Barrett’s hearing, Princeton University President Christopher L. Eisgruber said he was “deeply concerned by the harsh and often unfair criticisms that are now routinely levelled from both sides of the political spectrum against distinguished judicial nominees who would serve this country honorably and well,"" including Barrett. He urged the Senate Judiciary Committee to “refrain from interrogating nominees about the religious or spiritual foundations of their jurisprudential views.”

Barrett’s connections to a charismatic organization, the People of Praise, has also come under fire, especially as she’s made it onto the short list of the president’s Supreme Court picks. Barrett’s critics have called the group a “cult” and believe it could cloud her judgment on the nation’s highest court.

Barrett was also a trustee of the Trinity School, an education program founded by the People of Praise, from 2015 to 2017.

Read on for a look at the People of Praise and how Barrett fits into the group.

So what is the People of Praise?

On its website, the People of Praise bills itself as a “Christian community of families and single people who seek to participate in the mission of the church in our time and to live our lives communally until the day when Jesus will be all in all.”

It has members of many denominations, although the majority are Catholic.

The religious group also says it understands it can be difficult for some people to understand as “we are a community that defies categories.”

A LOOK AT THE PROCESS TO CONFIRM A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE

When Barrett’s involvement with the group first drew criticism in 2017, Craig S. Lent, a People of Praise leader and University of Notre Dame professor, defended it as something that’s not “nefarious or controversial.”

“We don’t try to control people,” he told The New York Times. “And there’s never any guarantee that the leader is always right. You have to discern and act in the Lord.”

Aside from its schools, the People of Praise also does mission work, especially in low-income or high-crime neighborhoods in Indiana.

What is this about ‘handmaids'?

According to The Times, male leaders in the group are referred to as “heads” and women are called “handmaids.” But Lent said the group has decided to use “woman leader” instead of handmaid in recent years.

“We follow the New Testament pattern of asking men to take on some spiritual responsibility for their families,” Lent said.

Is it political?

Bishop Peter Smith, an auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Portland, Oregon, told the Catholic News Agency (CNA) the group is non-partisan.

“I know for a fact there are both registered Republicans and Democrats as well as independents in the People of Praise,” Smith said. He is a part of the Brotherhood of the People of Praise, which CNA said is an association of priests who are connected to the organization.

Lent also told The New York Times the group would never tell a person in a political or judicial office ""how to discharge their responsibilities.”

How does one join the group?

One can join the People of Praise after what it calls “an initial period of discernment and preparation” -- something that can take as long as six years. After that, an individual is asked to make a covenant of a “promise of love and service to fellow community members and to God.”

TRUMP’S SUPREME COURT CANDIDATES: MEET THE NOMINEES

The covenant is not an oath or a vow, meaning it is not permanent.

How did it get its start?

The People of Praise began in 1971 in South Bend, Indiana, according to its website. Many of its founders were associated with the University of Notre Dame, the Catholic college where Barrett both studied and taught.

Now, there are 22 locations across the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean, according to its website. It boasts nearly 2,000 adult members.

What does this mean for Barrett?

Christians and conservatives have rushed to Barrett’s defense in wake of her reported inclusion on Trump’s short list for the Supreme Court.

Mona Charen, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, wrote, “If Barrett is a glazed-eyed cultist, she’s done an incredible job of hiding it.” The Washington Examiner’s Becket Adams called the judge “the sort of person who pro-abortion advocates and other left-leaning activists would do and say anything to block from taking a Supreme Court seat.”

In a column for Bloomberg, Ramesh Ponnuru implored the president to pick Barrett.

“If Democrats want to make a case against Barrett’s religion again, but with the added publicity a Supreme Court nomination would bring, it probably would not play better,” Ponnuru said.

Catholic League President Bill Donohue said Feinstein and Durbin should recuse themselves from the vote if Barrett is Trump’s pick because of their “anti-Catholic bias.”

“Not to do so would be intellectually dishonest and patently unfair to Judge Barrett,” Donohue said.

WHO ARE THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES?

Barrett’s faith could pose a challenge to future court decisions regarding abortion, a practice that most Christians and Catholics are fundamentally opposed to.

On the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion, Barrett has said, “I’m sure every nominee before you would have personal beliefs about that precedent and many others. But all nominees are united in their belief that what they think about a precedent should not bear on how they will decide cases.”

Two years ago, just before the presidential election, she said she didn’t think that the “core case” of Roe v. Wade would be overturned.

“I think the question of whether people can get late-term abortions -- how many restrictions can be put on clinics -- I don’t think that will change,” she said.

She described abortion as “always immoral” on a White House questionnaire last year. But she said then, “If I am confirmed, my views on this or any other question will have no bearing on the discharge of my duties as a judge.”

'Big Bang' star Kaley Couco undergoes shoulder surgery days after marrying Karl Cook,['Julius Young'],"It looks like “Big Bang Theory” star Kaley Cuoco’s honeymoon with Karl Cook has been cut short, although we’re unsure if it ever began.

Cuoco posted a photo to Instagram on Thursday of herself bedridden in the hospital and recovering from an apparent shoulder surgery.

The photo came with the caption: “When your ‘honeymoon’ is shoulder surgery and your husband looks just as happy lol on the road to recovery - thank you for all the love and support!”

In the pic, Couco’s husband, Karl stares at the camera with a Cheshire catlike smile on his face while Couco looks grim and disheveled.

Cuoco’s caption continued, “knowing @mrtankcook I’m sure he will be posting tons of hilarious gems -- thank god my hair color is on point.”

MSNBC dusts off 1990s comedian Sinbad to slam 'post-dementia' President Trump,['Brian Flood'],"MSNBC fired up the wayback machine and turned to 1990s comedian and former ""Celebrity Apprentice"" contestant Sinbad to slam President Trump on Thursday.

MSNBC host Ari Melber said the ""Coneheads"" star was qualified to comment on the president because the country is engaged in a “culture war” and Sinbad is “a figure in the culture."" Melber asked, “Why do you think he’s picking these fights with everyone from the NFL to [Robert] De Niro?”

“There is two different Donald Trump’s. There is the Donald Trump of the 90s… Now you’ve got this other one. The post-dementia Donald Trump who just loves picking fights because I think he’s a lonely man,” Sinbad said.

Sinbad then claimed Trump “never really had a lot of friends” and has always wanted to be “popular.”

Sinbad appeared alongside Trump on “Celebrity Apprentice” back in 2010. Trump fired him in the second week of the season.

Sinbad has been salty about getting fired by Trump for years, and expressed regret that he didn’t mock Trump’s hair to his face during a HuffPost interview in 2013. It’s unclear if he has had any contact with Trump in the past eight years but that didn’t stop him from analyzing the president.

“He wants to be a celebrity, and he loves being able to Twitter slam people because he can’t meet them face to face. He’s not good with that,” Sinbad said despite the fact that he was once fired, face-to-face, by Trump.

The comedian then called Trump a “keyboard gangsta” who “wouldn’t hurt a fly.”

Sinbad said Trump didn’t want to be the president and was simply aiming to land a TV show out of the popularity he gained during the 2016 campaign. Melber did not remind Sinbad that Trump actually had to walk away from his TV show, “Celebrity Apprentice,” to pursue a political career.

Sinbad’s appearance on MSNBC comes two weeks after fellow 1990s celebrity Tom Arnold was given a platform on both CNN and MSNBC to go after the president. Arnold promoted an upcoming Vice series called “The Hunt for the Trump Tapes"" that is expected to focus on would-be damaging recordings of the president that Arnold once claimed to own.

The comedian said on KIRO radio's ""The Dori Monson Show"" after the election that he was sent the outtakes as part of a ""Christmas video"" by producers of the show. He said they sent it around as a ""funny"" video when Trump announced his candidacy and they had no faith he had a chance of winning.

""I have the outtakes to 'The Apprentice' where he says every bad thing ever, every offensive, racist thing ever,"" Arnold claimed.

The Republican National Committee recently released a video called “The Left in 2018: Unhinged,” that depicts irrational rhetoric and actions aimed at Trump by comedians such as Kathy Griffin and Samantha Bee.",http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/entertainment/2018/07/06/msnbc-dusts-off-1990s-comedian-sinbad-to-slam-post-dementia-president-trump/_jcr_content/par/featured_image/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1530884877012.jpg?ve=1,[],http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2018/07/06/msnbc-dusts-off-1990s-comedian-sinbad-to-slam-post-dementia-president-trump.html,2018-07-06 00:00:00
Indiana teen killed by basketball backboard in freak accident,[],"A 14-year-old boy in Indiana died Friday when a basketball backboard fell on him while he was playing with his younger sister, reports said.

Nolan Gerwels was playing Friday evening on an indoor court in the South Bend suburb of Granger when the rim, backboard and supporting bracket came out of the wall and fell on him, St. Joseph County police said.

Police said Nolan suffered apparent head injuries and was pronounced dead at a hospital.

""Obviously this is an extremely unusual event, so we’re doing a little bit of investigation in terms of just exactly how the goal and the support bracket for it was anchored to the wall,"" St. Joseph County Police Assistant Chief Bill Thompson told IndyStar.

Margaret Gerwels says her son was an honors student at middle school who loved sports and hoped to make the freshman basketball team this coming school year at Marian High School in Mishawaka.

""This is horrific and overwhelming,"" Gerwels said in a statement. ""We are a close family, so everyone bears this heavy weight of his absence. He was so, so loved by everyone.""

Businesses hit pause on spending amid trade uncertainty: Fed minutes,['Matthew Rocco'],"The possibility of a full-blown trade war has forced some companies to pause investment plans, the Federal Reserve said Thursday.

Continue Reading Below

In minutes of its June meeting, the central bank’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) noted that contacts across 12 districts have “expressed concern” that tariffs and other proposed trade restrictions would have adverse effects on their businesses. Some business contacts said capital spending plans were scaled back or postponed given uncertainty over global trade policy.

“Most [FOMC] participants noted that uncertainty and risks associated with trade policy had intensified and were concerned that such uncertainty and risks eventually could have negative effects on business sentiment and investment spending,” the Fed said.

Contacts in the steel and aluminum industries said they already expect higher prices due to import tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, according to the minutes. Those contacts did not report any plans to increase domestic capacity.

Concerns over a tariff spat between the U.S. and trade partners, including China, Canada and the European Union, could dampen expectations for a fourth rate hike in 2018.

In June, the Fed raised short-term interest rates for the second time this year and expects to increase rates twice more before the end of the 2018.

Wisconsin newlyweds nearly struck with falling tree branch,['Janine Puhak'],"Two Wisconsin newlyweds are thanking their lucky stars after narrowly dodging a falling tree branch – and a potential tragedy – on their big day.

Cheyenne and Lucas Kopeschka said “I do” on June 30, in an outdoor ceremony in Fredonia, Fox 6 reports. Sitting side-by-side at a picnic table after the wedding, the pair were drinking beer and discussing their affection for each other on camera just moments before the scare.

VETERAN, FIANCÉE WIN 'DREAM WEDDING' IN AUCTION AFTER COUPLE CALLS IT QUITS

In the footage, shot by Freddy Hernandez Photography & Media, the bride had just finished recalling one of the first things she loved about her beau (his Nikes) when the groom began to speak, and branches began to loudly crackle overhead.

The startled pair is then seen running out of the frame as a massive, leafy branch falls where they were sitting.

""Oh s----"" someone can be heard saying in the background. “Oh my god!” another adds.

“You always see stuff like this on YouTube videos but never in real life and when we saw it, we were all just shaken up,” Freddy Hernandez told CBS 58 of the moment, which has since been viewed over 17,000 times on Facebook.

He further divulged that right after the branch fell, Cheyenne mused, “Our love is forever going to be stronger than that tree.”

Incredibly, the new Mr. and Mrs. returned to the same picnic table to finish the video interview.

“We’ve never seen anything like this,” Hernandez said. “Just happy they walked out. We had an amazing rest of the day. They didn’t let this ruin their day.”

The couple isn't exactly hoping guests forget about the moment either, as they incorporated footage of the scene into their wedding video, along with more traditional moments like releasing a dove and celebrating their walk down the aisle.

Judge Jeanine: Gowdy's Statement on Trump 'Spy' Claims Is 'Ridiculous',[],"Judge Jeanine Pirro said she is fired up, angry and confused by Rep. Trey Gowdy's (R-S.C.) statement that the FBI acted properly in its use of an informant in the Trump campaign to root out possible Russian meddling in the 2016 race.

“I am even more convinced that the FBI did exactly what my fellow citizens would want them to do when they got the information they got,” Gowdy said on “The Story” last week, adding that the move had “nothing to do with Donald Trump.”

Pirro said Gowdy, the chairman of the House Oversight & Government Reform Committee, said she's shocked by Gowdy's remarks, calling him one of the few people in Washington, D.C., who has the intelligence, expertise and ability to see through the ""nonsense"" -- and possible ""illegality"" -- going on at the FBI and Justice Department.

Instead of her typical opening statement, Pirro spoke to several of Gowdy's closest colleagues: Reps. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) about the FBI's use of an informant -- or ""spy"" -- in the Trump campaign.

Stephen Miller Furious At ProPublica For Only Releasing 7-Minute Recording Of Immigrant Children Sobbing,['The Onion'],"WASHINGTON—Claiming that the publication of such a brief, tantalizing bit of audio was a breach of their journalistic responsibility, a furious Stephen Miller told reporters Tuesday that he was outraged at ProPublica for only releasing seven minutes of immigrant children sobbing. “It’s unacceptable that this so-called news organization saw fit to foist this total tease of a clip on the American public,” said Miller, who expressed frustration that the audio, in which 10 detained Central American children can be heard crying out for their parents, ended before reaching “the really good stuff.” “Sure, they’re wailing ‘Mami’ and ‘Papa’ so hard they can’t breathe, and I guess the part where that 6-year-old desperately rattles off her aunt’s phone number is kind of satisfying, but ultimately it only conveys a very small fraction of what we’re doing here. I’ve listened to this recording dozens and dozens of times in the past day, and it’s just simply nowhere near enough to scratch the itch. Shame on you, ProPublica.” Miller added that the one silver lining was the likelihood that other outlets would soon broadcast hours of comprehensive, high-quality footage of immigrant children being tormented.

Lionel Messi Pissed After Forgetting To Wear Fitbit During Last Game,['The Onion'],"MOSCOW—Lamenting that his fitness goals would now be thrown off for the rest of the World Cup, Argentinian forward Lionel Messi was reportedly pissed off Saturday after forgetting to wear his Fitbit watch during a group stage match against Iceland. “Shit. Of course the one time I leave it in the locker room, I go out there and run, like, 10,000 steps,” said the five-time Ballon d’Or winner, adding that failing to log his activity stung even harder because he was merely 800 steps away from earning Fitbit’s “Ruby Slippers” badge, which he’d been attempting to earn throughout Argentina’s warm-up matches. “Ugh, now I’m going to have this weird dip in my activity, and my World Cup weight goal is totally going to be messed up. And I just know Sergio [Agüero] is going to rub it in my face—he was running like a mad man out there; there’s no way he didn’t beat my step record.” At press time, team sources confirmed Messi had since placed his Fitbit back on his wrist and was doing laps around Spartak Stadium to rack up extra miles.

It just feels weird standing around while everyone is fighting 20 feet away,” said Foster, who wavered between his options while considering if he should run on the field and tackle a Tampa Bay player who was pulling Red Sox outfielder J.D. Martinez off the Ray’s third-base coach. “Maybe I could break up a fight, just so none of our guys get hurt. I should be looking out for them, right? Even the goddamn equipment manager is out there. Maybe I can just sneak up on someone and cold-cock them before anyone notices.” At press time, Foster had stepped onto the field only to be knocked out by an errant elbow from Red Sox pitcher Chris Sale.

You’ve been talking for three seconds, for Christ’s sake! It’s almost enough to make a guy feel like what he has to say isn’t way more important than whatever she was already saying.” Ferris added that any woman who impolitely refused to be interrupted was a major obstacle to productivity, as she made it much more difficult to repeat her ideas 10 seconds later as if they were his own.

For this reason, I am humbly stepping down from my post.”
